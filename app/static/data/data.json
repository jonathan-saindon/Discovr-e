En ce qui a trait au patrimoine naturel, les Ã©cosystÃ¨mes illustrent l'interaction constante entre le milieu naturel et l'activitÃ© humaine depuis des siÃ¨cles.

Elle influence dans une moindre mesure le lotissement, de formes et de dimensions variÃ©es. Deux routes traversent le site, soit la voie Camillien-Houde, nommÃ©e chemin Remembrance sur une partie de son parcours, et le chemin de la CÃ´te-des-Neiges. La silhouette de la Montagne qui domine le centre-ville, les coupes rocheuses qui ceinturent certaines voies (notamment la voie Camillien-Houde) et les escarpements qui exposent les phÃ©nomÃ¨nes gÃ©ologiques constituent des Ã©lÃ©ments uniques du paysage naturel montrÃ©alais.\n\nLes flancs de la Montagne sont ceinturÃ©s par des bÃ¢timents institutionnels et des zones d'habitation crÃ©Ã©s du XIXe siÃ¨cle Ã  nos jours. On y trouve des institutions religieuses et Ã©ducatives, des complexes hospitaliers, des lieux de culte, des quartiers rÃ©sidentiels et des Ã©quipements publics.\n\nUn grand nombre de spÃ©cialistes de l'amÃ©nagement, d'architectes et d'artistes, tant locaux qu'Ã©trangers, ont contribuÃ© Ã  constituer le patrimoine architectural et paysager.
