En 1788, les autoritÃ©s du SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec, alors propriÃ©taires de la seigneurie, confient l'administration de l'endroit au notaire Joseph Papineau (1752-1841). Le SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec lui cÃ¨de une partie de la seigneurie en 1801. Deux ans plus tard, Papineau acquiert le reste du territoire de La Petite-Nation.

En 1899, il rejoint le deuxiÃ¨me bataillon du Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry pour participer Ã  la Guerre des Boers (1899-1902). Il se dÃ©marque Ã  la bataille de Paardeberg par ses actes de bravoure, et ses supÃ©rieurs le recommandent pour la Croix de Victoria. La dÃ©coration lui est refusÃ©e, mais il se voit accorder l'Ã‰charpe d'honneur de la Reine. L'objet confectionnÃ© par la reine Victoria (1819-1901) a Ã©tÃ© remis Ã  seulement huit soldats, dont quatre issus des colonies britanniques. Thompson est le seul Canadien Ã  avoir obtenu cet honneur. En 1913, la famille Church se dÃ©partit de plusieurs de ses terres, dont le cimetiÃ¨re familial. Le site est ensuite graduellement abandonnÃ©. La veuve de Thompson, Bertha Alexander (morte en 1962), est la derniÃ¨re personne Ã  avoir Ã©tÃ© inhumÃ©e en ce lieu. \n\nÃ€ la suite de la cÃ©lÃ©bration du centenaire de la crÃ©ation de la Croix de Victoria en 1956, le journal Â« Illustrated London News Â» publie un article sur les Ã©charpes d'honneur dans lequel le nom de Thompson est mentionnÃ©. Les autoritÃ©s militaires canadiennes dÃ©cident alors de localiser la dÃ©pouille du soldat. ParallÃ¨lement Ã  ce regain d'intÃ©rÃªt pour le lieu de sÃ©pulture, un groupe de citoyens de la rÃ©gion fonde en 1962 la SociÃ©tÃ© historique de Gatineau. DÃ¨s 1964, l'organisation travaille avec le dÃ©lÃ©guÃ© de la DÃ©fense nationale pour mettre en valeur le cimetiÃ¨re et la sÃ©pulture du soldat Thompson, qui n'est alors marquÃ©e d'aucune pierre tombale. \n\nEn 1966, la sociÃ©tÃ© historique acquiert le lieu de sÃ©pulture. L'annÃ©e suivante, une nouvelle entrÃ©e donnant sur la route 105 est amÃ©nagÃ©e. Le nouvel accÃ¨s est soulignÃ© par deux piliers de maÃ§onnerie offerts par des membres de la famille Thompson. Une pierre tombale est Ã©galement installÃ©e Ã  l'emplacement de la sÃ©pulture du soldat. \n\nÃ€ partir de 1986, la sociÃ©tÃ© historique organise une cÃ©rÃ©monie dans le cimetiÃ¨re pour souligner le jour du Souvenir (11 novembre).

La pratique du pÃ¨lerinage au QuÃ©bec commence Ã  la suite de l'Ã©tablissement du sanctuaire de Sainte-Anne-de-BeauprÃ©, Ã  la fin du XVIIe siÃ¨cle. Ce dernier est suivi du sanctuaire de Notre-Dame-du-Cap, au Cap-de-la-Madeleine, en 1714. Toutefois, la majoritÃ© des lieux de pÃ¨lerinage quÃ©bÃ©cois sont fondÃ©s entre 1840 et 1900. \n\nLe site est amÃ©nagÃ© au sommet du mont Saint-Joseph, appelÃ© mont TracadiÃ¨che ou Cap FerrÃ© jusqu'Ã  la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Les Micmacs y auraient tenu des cÃ©lÃ©brations bien avant la consÃ©cration de la montagne comme lieu de pÃ¨lerinage. Le premier pÃ¨lerinage connu remonte Ã  l'annÃ©e 1868, alors que mÃ¨re Marie-Anne Marcelle Mallet (1805-1871) installe une statue du SacrÃ©-Coeur au sommet. Dix ans plus tard, une croix de sept mÃ¨tres de hauteur y est plantÃ©e. Un incendie majeur ravage une partie de la montagne en 1923, mais la petite statue de saint Joseph est Ã©pargnÃ©e. En 1925, la paroisse fait Ã©riger une nouvelle statue, cette fois-ci Ã  l'effigie de son patron, saint Joseph. C'est Ã  ce moment que les pÃ¨lerinages au mont Saint-Joseph deviennent populaires dans la rÃ©gion. Le chemin menant au lieu de pÃ¨lerinage est rendu carrossable au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1930, et une premiÃ¨re chapelle est construite sur le site en 1935. \n\nCette premiÃ¨re chapelle, de petite dimension, est construite selon les plans de l'architecte Charles-A. Jean avec de la pierre prise sur la montagne. Au dÃ©but, on y cÃ©lÃ¨bre uniquement le culte de saint Joseph. Plus tard, dans le contexte de l'annÃ©e mariale de 1954, une dÃ©votion Ã  la Vierge s'y ajoute. Le lieu prend alors le nom d'oratoire Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Saint-Joseph. Une petite rÃ©sidence nommÃ©e Ermitage est construite Ã  proximitÃ© de l'oratoire, en 1955, afin de loger un prÃªtre durant l'Ã©tÃ©.

Au dÃ©but du XVIIe siÃ¨cle, les missionnaires franÃ§ais empruntent la riviÃ¨re des Prairies pour accÃ©der Ã  l'Outaouais et au pays des Hurons. En 1625, avant mÃªme la fondation de Ville-Marie, le rÃ©collet Nicolas Viel et le FranÃ§ais surnommÃ© en huron \"Ahuntsic\", se noient dans les rapides.\n\nEn 1696, les Sulpiciens, seigneurs de l'Ã®le de MontrÃ©al, amorcent le dÃ©placement de la mission amÃ©rindienne du fort de la Montagne vers le Sault-au-RÃ©collet. Ils y amÃ©nagent un vaste domaine et font construire le fort Lorette. Les AmÃ©rindiens convertis au catholicisme s'installent Ã  proximitÃ© et cultivent les champs. Le dÃ©part de la mission vers Oka en 1721 marque le vÃ©ritable dÃ©but de la colonisation de la cÃ´te de Nouvelle-Lorette. Les Sulpiciens y concÃ¨dent des terres et encadrent la nouvelle sociÃ©tÃ© rurale. En 1726, ils construisent une digue entre la rive et l'Ã®le de la Visitation. L'Ã©nergie hydraulique des rapides alimentera leurs moulins, le plus important complexe proto-industriel de la rÃ©gion Ã  cette Ã©poque. En 1736, le peuplement des campagnes environnantes entraÃ®ne la crÃ©ation de la paroisse de la Visitation-du-Sault-au-RÃ©collet dont la nouvelle Ã©glise est inaugurÃ©e en 1751.\n\nEn prÃ©vision de l'Ã©mergence d'un village au sein de la paroisse rurale, les Sulpiciens rÃ©servent une portion de leur domaine Ã  cette fin. Loti vers 1768, le village connaÃ®t une forte croissance au XIXe siÃ¨cle. Il devient un centre de services pour les campagnes avoisinantes et un important lieu de production industrielle. Sa prospÃ©ritÃ© s'exprime dans son cadre bÃ¢ti, enrichi par des maisons villageoises aux gabarits plus imposants, des rÃ©sidences de notables et l'agrandissement de l'Ã©glise (1850-1851). Ã€ partir du milieu du siÃ¨cle, des institutions religieuses s'implantent au Sault-au-RÃ©collet, attirÃ©es par son cadre pittoresque et les propriÃ©tÃ©s mises Ã  leur disposition. Les JÃ©suites et les Dames du SacrÃ©-Coeur y font construire des immeubles imposants. L'Ã©vÃªque de MontrÃ©al, monseigneur Bourget (1799-1885), Ã©lit lui-mÃªme domicile au Sault au moment de sa retraite. ArrivÃ©s en 1888, les FrÃ¨res de Saint-Gabriel y Ã©tablissent leur noviciat et leur maison provinciale. L'ouverture de la crÃ¨che Saint-Paul en 1909 complÃ¨te le noyau institutionnel situÃ© Ã  l'ouest du village. \n\nAu dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, le Sault-au-RÃ©collet attire des villÃ©giateurs montrÃ©alais. Leurs dÃ©placements sont facilitÃ©s par le tramway arrivÃ© en 1895. Des villas sont construites en bordure de la riviÃ¨re, surtout Ã  l'est du village, et d'anciennes maisons villageoises deviennent des rÃ©sidences secondaires. Ã‰rigÃ© en municipalitÃ© de village en 1910, Sault-au-RÃ©collet acquiert le statut de ville en 1914, mais est annexÃ© Ã  MontrÃ©al en 1916.\n\nDe nouvelles constructions, insÃ©rÃ©es dans le tissu villageois, tÃ©moignent de l'urbanisation du territoire. La zone riveraine connaÃ®t aussi des transformations. La construction d'une centrale hydroÃ©lectrique sur la riviÃ¨re fait disparaÃ®tre les rapides, modifie la configuration des Ã®les et altÃ¨re l'aspect des berges. AprÃ¨s 1945, le Sault-au-RÃ©collet renforce sa vocation de banlieue rÃ©sidentielle. Le lotissement de certaines grandes propriÃ©tÃ©s, les nouvelles constructions, les dÃ©molitions et l'amÃ©nagement d'infrastructures de transport perturbent le milieu. \n\nÃ€ partir des annÃ©es 1970, des initiatives revalorisent l'environnement naturel et le patrimoine du secteur.

Le chemin du Roy (l'actuelle rue Fraser), Ã©tabli au tournant du XIXe siÃ¨cle, plus au sud que le parcours initial, traverse le territoire d'ouest en est.\n\nLa paroisse de Saint-Patrice est Ã©rigÃ©e en 1833 et englobe ce territoire agricole en marge du noyau villageois. Ã€ partir de 1840, les habitations rurales de l'actuel site sont construites. Il s'agit de maisons quÃ©bÃ©coises d'esprit nÃ©oclassique avec leurs toits Ã  deux versants retroussÃ©s, leurs galeries couvertes et l'ordonnance symÃ©trique de leurs ouvertures. Plusieurs dÃ©pendances agricoles complÃ¨tent les propriÃ©tÃ©s. Ce secteur a alors une vocation agricole. Un certain nombre de bÃ¢timents du site tÃ©moignent de cette pÃ©riode, dont la maison HomÃ©rile-Boucher.\n\nAu cours de la dÃ©cennie 1850, les lieux retiennent l'attention de familles bourgeoises anglophones, qui s'y installent pour la pÃ©riode estivale. Ã€ l'image d'autres agglomÃ©rations du Bas-Saint-Laurent, le secteur attire des estivants de MontrÃ©al et d'Ottawa qui dÃ©sirent profiter d'un environnement naturel de qualitÃ©. Ces premiers rÃ©sidents estivaux louent d'abord les maisons des fermiers. Ils achÃ¨tent ensuite des terres afin d'y construire des rÃ©sidences secondaires. Leurs bÃ¢timents sont principalement implantÃ©s en retrait du cÃ´tÃ© nord du chemin du Roy, renommÃ© rue Fraser en 1851. L'arrivÃ©e du chemin de fer vers 1860 facilite l'accÃ¨s Ã  RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup. Cette derniÃ¨re devient le terminus est du chemin de fer du Grand-Tronc, contribuant Ã  en faire la mÃ©tropole du Bas-Saint-Laurent. Un premier bureau de poste est ouvert dans le secteur par Abraham Joseph en 1879.\n\nLes estivants font connaÃ®tre l'endroit, suscitant un engouement auprÃ¨s de la classe politique. Entre 1871 et 1890, le premier ministre du Canada John A. Macdonald (1815-1891) occupe une maison d'Ã©tÃ© Ã  Saint-Patrice. Au cours de cette pÃ©riode, les gouverneurs gÃ©nÃ©raux Lord Monck (Charles Stanley Monck, 1819-1894) et Lord Dufferin (Frederick Temple Blackwood, 1826-1902) louent des rÃ©sidences. Au dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, la bourgeoisie d'affaires s'ajoute Ã  cette premiÃ¨re vague. Elle entraÃ®ne la subdivision de plusieurs terres aux abords de la rue Fraser ainsi qu'une intensification de la construction rÃ©sidentielle. Pour rÃ©pondre aux besoins des nouveaux rÃ©sidents en matiÃ¨re de loisirs, un golf est amÃ©nagÃ© en 1902.\n\nLa communautÃ© anglophone apporte ses traditions, notamment en architecture et en amÃ©nagement. Les maisons de villÃ©giature s'inspirent des courants architecturaux Ã  la mode de l'Ã©poque, dont l'architecture pittoresque et le style Second Empire. Pour leur part, les amÃ©nagements paysagers se composent d'allÃ©es, de jardins et de courts de tennis. Des Ã©crans d'arbres et de haies, disposÃ©s en bordure de la rue Fraser, isolent les propriÃ©tÃ©s de la route sinueuse. Les effets de surprise qui en rÃ©sultent sont typiques du mouvement pittoresque.\n\nLa vocation de villÃ©giature du secteur se poursuit au XXe siÃ¨cle, alors que les agriculteurs continuent de louer ou de vendre leurs propriÃ©tÃ©s aux estivants. Certains d'entres eux ouvrent des Ã©tablissements destinÃ©s aux touristes tels que la pension Chouinard, ou encore dans les annÃ©es 1940 le St. Patrick Inn. De 1950 Ã  1971, le premier ministre canadien Louis S. Saint-Laurent (1882-1973) rÃ©side Ã  Saint-Patrice durant l'Ã©tÃ©.

Taylor Waldleigh est l'un des premiers colons Ã  s'Ã©tablir, en 1818, dans ce lieu qui est nommÃ© Massawippi Outlet avant de prendre le nom de North Hatley avec l'ouverture du premier bureau de poste vers 1859. En 1867, la population est seulement de 50 habitants qui vivent principalement de l'agriculture et de la production de la potasse. Parmi les familles pionniÃ¨res telles que les Wadleigh, Davies, Hovey, Jackson, Little, Reed, la famille LeBaron s'est investie activement dans le dÃ©veloppement du village.\n\nDans la seconde moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle, North Hatley devient une destination touristique trÃ¨s recherchÃ©e.

GrÃ¢ce au paysage pittoresque que forment le lac et les montagnes, en plus de l'abondance et de la variÃ©tÃ© du poisson et du gibier qu'ils offrent, North Hatley se transforme en lieu de villÃ©giature prestigieux.\n\nLe dÃ©veloppement des chemins de fer dans le dernier tiers du XIXe siÃ¨cle a considÃ©rablement facilitÃ© l'accÃ¨s Ã  North Hatley. La compagnie Ã©tatsunienne Massawippi Valley Railway construit une voie ferrÃ©e qui relie Lennoxville et Newport (Vermont). AchevÃ©e en 1870, elle longe la rive est du lac entre Ayer's Cliff et North Hatley. Elle encourage l'arrivÃ©e de touristes par centaines. Le village devient rapidement un lieu de sÃ©jour oÃ¹ de riches familles bourgeoises, notamment Ã©tatsuniennes et montrÃ©alaises, construisent des rÃ©sidences d'Ã©tÃ© cossues.

Quatre bateaux Ã  vapeur naviguent sur le lac Massawippi entre 1879 et 1915. Ils offrent des excursions avec des escales dans les villages riverains et Ã  certains hÃ´tels implantÃ©s en bordure du lac. De plus, chaque grand hÃ´tel possÃ¨de son propre bateau. Une vie culturelle et des clubs sportifs, tels le Massawippi Canoe Club (1883), le North Hatley Canoe Club (vers 1897) et un premier club de golf (1899), donnent aux habitants et aux visiteurs l'occasion de se divertir. Des fÃªtes nautiques attirent de grandes foules.\n\nC'est dans cette pÃ©riode de prospÃ©ritÃ© que la municipalitÃ© de North Hatley est officiellement fondÃ©e, soit en 1897.\n\nDes lieux de culte sont Ã©rigÃ©s afin de desservir les habitants et les visiteurs de diverses confessions. Les Anglicans construisent une Ã©glise en 1893 et 1894 selon les plans de l'architecte Ã©tatsunien de renom Bertram Goodhue (1869-1924). La communautÃ© universaliste bÃ¢tit en 1895 une Ã©glise, sur un terrain donnÃ© par Benjamin LeBaron. La mÃªme annÃ©e, le village est dotÃ© d'une Ã©cole. L'Ã©difice est dÃ©placÃ© deux ans plus tard et acquis en 1908 par la communautÃ© baptiste qui le transforme en lieu de culte. Ces trois lieux de culte sont inclus dans le site du patrimoine.\n\nLe site du patrimoine de North Hatley est constituÃ© en 1987. Il est devenu un site patrimonial citÃ© Ã  l'entrÃ©e en vigueur de la Loi sur le patrimoine culturel en 2012.

Les pionniers choisissent d'abord la bordure immÃ©diate du fleuve Saint-Laurent, puis s'installent ensuite sur le plateau, le long du chemin du Roy (route Marie-Victorin actuelle). Au cours de la premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle, les constructions s'effectuent surtout dans ce secteur. \n\nGraduellement, les terres situÃ©es plus Ã  l'est sont dÃ©frichÃ©es, dont celles localisÃ©es aujourd'hui dans le site du patrimoine. Le bÃ¢ti commence Ã  y apparaÃ®tre dÃ¨s 1760, annÃ©e oÃ¹ aurait Ã©tÃ© Ã©rigÃ© le premier corps de logis de la maison PÃ¢quet. L'immeuble est successivement agrandi du cÃ´tÃ© est. L'Ã©difice qui, Ã  l'origine, est d'inspiration franÃ§aise prend, au XIXe siÃ¨cle, les allures de la maison traditionnelle quÃ©bÃ©coise avec l'ajout d'avant-toits courbÃ©s et de lucarnes Ã  pignon. En 1989, la maison PÃ¢quet subit une importante restauration qui lui rend son apparence d'origine. Elle est classÃ©e la mÃªme annÃ©e.\n\nLes autres maisons aujourd'hui intÃ©grÃ©es au site du patrimoine ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©rigÃ©es entre 1800 et 1880, de part et d'autre de la maison PÃ¢quet, essentiellement du cÃ´tÃ© nord de la route. Il s'agissait en fait de propriÃ©tÃ©s agricoles qui comptaient plusieurs bÃ¢timents secondaires. Ces Ã©difices sont aujourd'hui surtout Ã  vocation rÃ©sidentielle, mÃªme si la vocation agricole est encore bien prÃ©sente dans le secteur.\n\nEn 1867, monseigneur Benjamin PÃ¢quet (1832-1900) Ã©rige, du cÃ´tÃ© sud de la route, la chapelle Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce, en guise d'ex-voto. L'immeuble s'inspire du style nÃ©ogothique. Une sacristie est construite en 1896 le long du mur ouest, puis un porche, en faÃ§ade, l'annÃ©e suivante. DÃ©moli en 1956, ce magnifique porche nÃ©ogothique est reconstruit Ã  la suite d'une restauration soignÃ©e survenue en 1999 et 2000. La chapelle sert au culte jusqu'au milieu du XXe siÃ¨cle. Elle est classÃ©e en 1989.\n\nEn 1887, monseigneur PÃ¢quet, alors recteur de l'UniversitÃ© Laval, fait construire un ermitage Ã  l'arriÃ¨re de la chapelle Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce. Elle sert de rÃ©sidence d'Ã©tÃ© et devient alors un lieu vouÃ© au repos, Ã  l'Ã©ducation religieuse, Ã  la mÃ©ditation et Ã  la priÃ¨re. Le bÃ¢timent s'inspire de l'architecture Second Empire alors en vogue, et il se caractÃ©rise notamment par sa toiture mansardÃ©e.

Vers 1835, les premiers colons dÃ©frichent des terres dans ce qui est alors connu comme l'augmentation de la seigneurie des Mille-ÃŽles. Ils viennent de la plaine de MontrÃ©al, de mÃªme que de Saint-JÃ©rÃ´me, de Saint-Eustache, de Saint-Hermas, de Sainte-Scholastique et de Saint-Janvier. En 1850, la presque totalitÃ© des terres est occupÃ©e. La mÃªme annÃ©e, les habitants de la partie nord-est de l'augmentation de la seigneurie rÃ©clament la crÃ©ation d'une mission, qui voit le jour sous la dÃ©nomination de La Circoncision. Elle est rapidement renommÃ©e Saint-Sauveur. Deux hameaux existent Ã  l'Ã©poque, Piedmont et Saint-Sauveur, et chacun d'eux rÃ©clame la construction d'un lieu de culte. C'est finalement Saint-Sauveur qui est choisi, vraisemblablement Ã  cause de sa position plus centrale. Une chapelle de bois est donc construite en 1853 Ã  l'emplacement de l'Ã©glise actuelle. En 1854, la paroisse de Saint-Sauveur est Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement, puis civilement l'annÃ©e suivante.\n\nEn 1880, le hameau de Saint-Sauveur ne compte qu'une seule rue flanquÃ©e de trottoirs en bois. Quelques maisons la bordent, surtout dans le secteur de la chapelle. C'est probablement Ã  cette Ã©poque que la rÃ©sidence sise au 186 rue Principale, vraisemblablement la plus ancienne subsistant aujourd'hui, est construite. En 1895, le lieu de culte, frappÃ© par la foudre, nÃ©cessite des rÃ©parations importantes. L'archevÃªque de MontrÃ©al incite alors les paroissiens Ã  se doter d'une nouvelle Ã©glise qui sera construite huit ans plus tard selon les plans de l'architecte montrÃ©alais Casimir Saint-Jean.\n\nLe prolongement du chemin de fer de Saint-JÃ©rÃ´me Ã  Sainte-Agathe en 1890 permet au tourisme de se dÃ©velopper dans la rÃ©gion. Au dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, les skieurs se font de plus en plus nombreux, ce qui incite des propriÃ©taires de la rue Principale et de l'avenue de la Gare Ã  transformer leur rÃ©sidence en maison de pension. Le premier quart du XXe siÃ¨cle demeure nÃ©anmoins difficile pour la paroisse, puisqu'elle voit sa population rÃ©gresser entre 1891 et 1921. \n\nEn 1926, le village de Saint-Sauveur-des-Monts se dÃ©tache de la paroisse de Saint-Sauveur. Au cours des annÃ©es 1930, l'industrie du ski entraÃ®ne un dÃ©veloppement fulgurant dans la rÃ©gion des Hautes-Laurentides. La multiplication des stations de ski oblige le Canadien Pacifique Ã  mettre sur pied les lÃ©gendaires Â« trains de neige Â» qui transportent les skieurs en provenance de MontrÃ©al. Saint-Sauveur se classe alors parmi les stations les plus prometteuses de la rÃ©gion. Reconnu pour son rÃ©seau de pistes et sa fameuse colline 70 qui est munie d'un remonte-pente permanent, le village se distingue Ã©galement par les cabines et les petits hÃ´tels de la rue Principale, parfois comparÃ©e Ã  une Â« petite Suisse Â». Cette pÃ©riode marque le dÃ©but d'une pÃ©riode de croissance importante. La municipalitÃ© voit sa population passer de 364 habitants en 1931 Ã  1066 en 1951.\n\nEn 1957, le presbytÃ¨re du village est la proie des flammes. Un nouvel Ã©difice est construit l'annÃ©e suivante. \n\nEn 1964, l'autoroute des Laurentides rejoint la municipalitÃ©, ce qui rend la rÃ©gion mÃ©tropolitaine beaucoup plus accessible. Ce prolongement fait apparaÃ®tre une double fonction touristico-rÃ©sidentielle dans le village, un type d'Ã©volution jusque-lÃ  inÃ©dit dans les Laurentides. Saint-Sauveur-des-Monts compte 1846 habitants en 1971.\n\nEn 1976, l'ancien tracÃ© du chemin de fer qui passait par le village est transformÃ© en route et devient le Boulevard, puis le chemin de la VallÃ©e, six ans plus tard.\n\nLe site du patrimoine de Saint-Sauveur-des-Monts est constituÃ© en 1989.

FormÃ© en droit Ã  l'UniversitÃ© Laval Ã  MontrÃ©al, Hector Authier (1881-1971) commence sa carriÃ¨re comme journaliste. En 1912, il est nommÃ© agent des terres et des mines pour l'Abitibi par Lomer Gouin (1861-1929), alors premier ministre du QuÃ©bec. DÃ¨s lors, il s'installe Ã  Amos dans une maison qu'il acquiert dÃ¨s son arrivÃ©e. Jusqu'en 1922, il travaille en faveur de la colonisation de la rÃ©gion. Notamment, il se familiarise avec le territoire et ses ressources, recrute des colons et veille aussi Ã  la crÃ©ation des infrastructures. Authier est Ã©galement actif sur la scÃ¨ne politique. Entre 1914 et 1918, il occupe simultanÃ©ment les fonctions de maire du village d'Amos et de prÃ©fet du comtÃ© d'Abitibi. Il est le premier maire d'Amos et le premier prÃ©fet du comtÃ©. En 1923, il est Ã©lu dÃ©putÃ© libÃ©ral dans le comtÃ© d'Abitibi. Il est nommÃ© ministre de la Colonisation en 1936 dans le gouvernement de Louis-Alexandre Taschereau (1867-1952), poste qu'il n'occupe que quelques mois. Entre 1940 et 1945, il siÃ¨ge Ã  la Chambre des communes comme dÃ©putÃ© libÃ©ral du comtÃ© de Chapleau. Par ailleurs, Authier s'illustre dans le monde des affaires.

DÃ¨s la seconde moitiÃ© du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle, quelques colons, surtout anglophones, s'installent dans la rÃ©gion. Au siÃ¨cle suivant, des Ã©tablissements se structurent autour d'exploitations forestiÃ¨res. Un rÃ©el dÃ©veloppement s'amorce Ã  la suite des initiatives du curÃ© Antoine Labelle (1833-1891) au tournant de la dÃ©cennie 1870. Le prÃªtre encourage la colonisation des hautes Laurentides par les Canadiens franÃ§ais afin de contrer l'Ã©migration vers les Ã‰tats-Unis et d'offrir une solution Ã  la crise Ã©conomique. Saint-Jovite, alors appelÃ© Â« mission Salaberry Â», est fondÃ© en 1872. L'ouverture des registres de la paroisse remonte Ã  1879. Le village, situÃ© au carrefour des chemins de colonisation, devient un centre nÃ©vralgique des hautes Laurentides, oÃ¹ les colons peuvent obtenir marchandises et services. L'arrivÃ©e du chemin de fer en 1893 stimule l'Ã©conomie locale. Outre l'agriculture pratiquÃ©e par les colons, le commerce du bois constitue le principal moteur Ã©conomique. \n\nÃ€ proximitÃ© de la gare Ã©merge le hameau de Saint-Jovite-Station, nom du secteur oÃ¹ se trouve le site du patrimoine Beattie-des-Pins. CrÃ©Ã© principalement de 1891 Ã  1910, il rÃ©sulte de l'Ã©tablissement de la compagnie G. H. Perley. Cette entreprise, propriÃ©tÃ© de George Halsey Perley (1857-1938), produit du bois de construction. Elle compte plusieurs rÃ©serves forestiÃ¨res et moulins dans la rÃ©gion. La prÃ©sence du chemin de fer et de la proximitÃ© de la matiÃ¨re premiÃ¨re incitent l'industrie Ã  s'implanter Ã  Saint-Jovite. En plus des bureaux, les rÃ©sidences des dirigeants anglophones ainsi que certains services, dont une chapelle, une Ã©cole et un pavillon sportif y sont construits. Cette agglomÃ©ration Ã©volue parallÃ¨lement au noyau villageois compte tenu, entre autres, des diffÃ©rences de langue, de religion et de statut social de sa population. \n\nAu tournant du XXe siÃ¨cle, le tourisme se dÃ©veloppe dans les environs grÃ¢ce, notamment, Ã  la popularitÃ© de la chasse et de la pÃªche. S'ensuit la construction d'un hÃ´tel luxueux et les dÃ©buts de la pratique du ski. La compagnie G. H. Perley poursuit ses activitÃ©s Ã  Saint-Jovite-Station jusqu'en 1912.

Ã€ partir des annÃ©es 1830, de nombreuses familles originaires de l'archipel des HÃ©brides, en Ã‰cosse, sont contraintes Ã  l'Ã©migration vers le Canada ou l'Australie. Certaines sont expulsÃ©es par les grands propriÃ©taires terriens. Ceux-ci veulent rentabiliser leurs terres en remplaÃ§ant les cultures par l'Ã©levage du mouton. D'autres familles sont chassÃ©es par la famine chronique, aggravÃ©e notamment par la maladie de la pomme de terre. En 1838 arrive un premier groupe d'environ 200 immigrants Ã©cossais, majoritairement originaires de l'Ã®le de Lewis, de foi presbytÃ©rienne et de langue gaÃ©lique. Ils s'installent dans le canton de Lingwick, sur des terres vendues par la British American Land Company (BALC). Leur nombre s'agrandit dans les dÃ©cennies suivantes. Vers le milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle, le gouvernement octroie des terres Ã  tout homme Ã¢gÃ© de plus de 18 ans. Beaucoup d'Ã‰cossais quittent alors les terres vendues par la BALC pour s'installer sur ces terres nouvellement ouvertes dans les cantons voisins, soit dans Winslow, Whitton, Marston et Hampden.\n\nDans la deuxiÃ¨me moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle, ces cantons sont peuplÃ©s en grande partie par les immigrants hÃ©bridÃ©ens et leurs descendants. Le lieu-dit Gisla est nommÃ© d'aprÃ¨s un hameau de l'Ã®le de Lewis. Le cimetiÃ¨re Gisla est vraisemblablement utilisÃ© comme lieu de sÃ©pulture depuis 1857. La petite agglomÃ©ration compte aussi, Ã  la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle, une Ã©glise presbytÃ©rienne. Toutefois, le hameau se dÃ©veloppe peu comparativement au village de Milan oÃ¹ passe le chemin de fer.\n\nDonald Morrison (1858-1894) est enterrÃ© dans le cimetiÃ¨re Gisla. Il est le fils d'un des pionniers du canton, Murdo Morrison (1818-1895) arrivÃ© de l'Ã®le de Lewis en 1838. Il conduit des troupeaux dans l'Ouest canadien durant de nombreuses annÃ©es pour soutenir financiÃ¨rement sa famille. En 1886, aprÃ¨s son retour dans les Cantons de l'Est, son pÃ¨re se trouve dans l'incapacitÃ© de rembourser ses dettes. Il perd ainsi la ferme familiale qui est aussitÃ´t revendue. En mai 1888, l'Ã©table de l'ancienne ferme familiale est incendiÃ©e et des coups de feu sont tirÃ©s sur la maison. Donald Morrison, ne cachant pas son dÃ©sir de vengeance, est immÃ©diatement soupÃ§onnÃ© de vandalisme et de tentative de meurtre. Puisque aucune police organisÃ©e ne peut l'arrÃªter, Lucius Warren (mort en 1888), un contrebandier amÃ©ricain, est engagÃ© pour l'apprÃ©hender. Le 22 juin 1888, les deux hommes se rencontrent dans la rue principale de Lac-MÃ©gantic. Warren est abattu par Morrison. AccusÃ© de meurtre, Morrison rÃ©ussit Ã  dÃ©jouer durant plusieurs mois les nombreux policiers envoyÃ©s de Sherbrooke, MontrÃ©al et QuÃ©bec pour l'arrÃªter. Il est cachÃ© et nourri par la communautÃ© Ã©cossaise de la rÃ©gion. MalgrÃ© la prime Ã©levÃ©e offerte en rÃ©compense pour sa capture, personne ne le dÃ©nonce. L'histoire du fugitif est racontÃ©e dans les journaux Ã  travers le pays et il devient cÃ©lÃ¨bre. Morrison est finalement capturÃ© en avril 1889 et condamnÃ© en octobre Ã  purger 18 ans de pÃ©nitencier Ã  MontrÃ©al. La santÃ© de Morrison dÃ©cline rapidement. Il est graciÃ© et il est libÃ©rÃ© le 19 juin 1894. ImmÃ©diatement transportÃ© Ã  l'hÃ´pital, il meurt quelques heures plus tard.\n\nÃ€ partir du dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, de nombreux Ã‰cossais de la rÃ©gion partent vers les centres urbains de la province, l'Ouest canadien ou les centres industriels de l'Ontario et du nord des Ã‰tats-Unis.

L'intendant Jean Talon (1625-1694) concÃ¨de en 1672 deux seigneuries formant le territoire actuel de Beaumont. La seigneurie de Beaumont est octroyÃ©e Ã  Charles Couillard (1647-1715), sieur des Islets, tandis que celle de Vincennes est accordÃ©e Ã  FranÃ§ois Bissot. Les deux seigneurs font Ã©riger respectivement leur manoir et des dÃ©pendances. La paroisse Saint-Ã‰tienne de Beaumont est fondÃ©e en 1692 et dessert les deux fiefs. Une petite chapelle en bois est Ã©levÃ©e Ã  cette Ã©poque dans la seigneurie de Beaumont. La localisation de la chapelle dicte l'emplacement du futur noyau villageois. La population de la paroisse agricole augmente lentement. Un chemin est tracÃ© en 1713 afin de faciliter les communications.\n\nLe noyau religieux se forme progressivement au cours du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle. Un premier presbytÃ¨re est Ã©rigÃ© en 1722. Une Ã©glise en pierre est construite entre 1726 et 1736 pour remplacer la chapelle en bois. Le nouveau lieu de culte est attribuÃ© Ã  Jean-Baptiste Maillou (1668-1753). Deux chapelles de procession en bois sont Ã©levÃ©es Ã  Ã©gale distance de part et d'autre de l'Ã©glise. Elles sont par la suite remplacÃ©es par des constructions de pierre : celle consacrÃ©e Ã  la Vierge en 1740 et l'autre, dÃ©diÃ©e Ã  sainte Anne, 60 ans plus tard. En 1759, l'Ã©glise est occupÃ©e par les troupes du gÃ©nÃ©ral Robert Monckton (1726-1782). L'ensemble religieux est nÃ©anmoins prÃ©servÃ© des destructions perpÃ©trÃ©es dans la rÃ©gion par les soldats britanniques. \n\nAu dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle, le centre du village est formÃ© des bÃ¢timents religieux, de quelques maisons de ferme et de leurs dÃ©pendances. Quelques artisans, commerÃ§ants et rentiers s'installent dans le petit noyau villageois vers le milieu du siÃ¨cle. Un moulin Ã  eau alimentant une scierie est construit. Le cadre bÃ¢ti reste peu dense et le village se dÃ©veloppe en s'Ã©tirant d'est en ouest. La municipalitÃ© de Saint-Ã‰tienne-de-Beaumont est Ã©rigÃ©e civilement en 1855. \n\nUn nouveau presbytÃ¨re est construit la mÃªme annÃ©e Ã  proximitÃ© de la premiÃ¨re maison curiale. Cette derniÃ¨re est transformÃ©e en Ã©cole en 1885 et sert Ã©galement de salle des habitants. Des travaux sont effectuÃ©s pour l'adapter Ã  ses nouvelles fonctions. L'Ã©glise de Saint-Ã‰tienne-de-Beaumont fait aussi l'objet de modifications. Un nouveau clocher est Ã©levÃ© en 1870 d'aprÃ¨s les plans de Joseph-Ferdinand Peachy (1830-1903). Une sacristie remplace celle du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle en 1886. Une chapelle latÃ©rale est Ã©galement ajoutÃ©e au lieu de culte. En 1922, le clocher est Ã  nouveau remplacÃ© au moment de l'agrandissement de l'Ã©glise par l'ajout d'une travÃ©e en faÃ§ade selon les plans de l'architecte Lorenzo Auger (1879-1942). Ces travaux concernent Ã©galement la rÃ©fection de la faÃ§ade. La salle paroissiale, Ã©levÃ©e vers 1950, complÃ¨te le noyau institutionnel du village. \n\nBeaumont demeure une localitÃ© essentiellement agricole jusque dans la seconde moitiÃ© du XXe siÃ¨cle.

Le dÃ©veloppement de la ville s'accÃ©lÃ¨re au moment de la construction du canal de Beauharnois, de 1842 Ã  1845. Cette voie de transport maritime favorise l'implantation d'industries. Dix ans aprÃ¨s l'inauguration du canal, la paroisse de Sainte-CÃ©cile est fondÃ©e. La premiÃ¨re Ã©glise est Ã©rigÃ©e en 1856 et 1857, suivie du presbytÃ¨re en 1864. Les soeurs des Saints-Noms-de-JÃ©sus-et-de-Marie enseignent aux jeunes filles campivallensiennes Ã  partir de 1866; toutefois, leur couvent n'est Ã©difiÃ© que quatre ans plus tard. La population de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield croÃ®t rapidement. Les architectes Maurice Perrault (1857-1909) et Albert Mesnard (1847-1909) conÃ§oivent donc une Ã©glise plus grande, Ã©rigÃ©e Ã  l'emplacement de la premiÃ¨re. Le chantier s'Ã©chelonne de 1882 Ã  1884. Le noyau institutionnel de la paroisse de Sainte-CÃ©cile prend de l'expansion au cours de la deuxiÃ¨me moitiÃ© de la dÃ©cennie avec la construction de l'hospice Saint-Vincent-de-Paul et d'un nouveau presbytÃ¨re. Les soeurs de la Providence deviennent responsables de l'hospice et s'y installent en 1889. La paroisse de Sainte-CÃ©cile est choisie comme siÃ¨ge Ã©piscopal lors de la crÃ©ation du diocÃ¨se de Valleyfield en 1892. L'Ã©glise de Sainte-CÃ©cile devient donc cathÃ©drale.\n\nLe premier hospice Ã©tant devenu trop petit, l'architecte L.-H. Thibodeau dessine un nouvel Ã©difice pour les soeurs de la Providence en 1894. En plus d'hÃ©berger les religieuses, plusieurs services y sont offerts, notamment l'Ã©ducation des jeunes enfants ainsi que l'hospitalitÃ© aux prÃªtres retraitÃ©s, aux orphelines, aux dames Ã¢gÃ©es et infirmes. Ã€ partir de 1898, les vieillards ont Ã©galement accÃ¨s Ã  l'hospice. De 1925 Ã  1928, d'autres travaux sont effectuÃ©s pour l'agrandir du cÃ´tÃ© nord et le surhausser. \n\nEn 1933, un incendie se dÃ©clare dans la cathÃ©drale, puis s'Ã©tend aux Ã©difices des soeurs des Saints-Noms-de-JÃ©sus-et-de-Marie. Le lieu de culte et le couvent sont reconstruits l'annÃ©e suivante. Joseph DalbÃ© Viau (1889-1938) et Louis-Alphonse Venne (1875-1934) dressent les plans de ce dernier. La cathÃ©drale est conÃ§ue par l'architecte montrÃ©alais Henri Sicotte-Labelle (nÃ© en 1896), assistÃ© des architectes EugÃ¨ne Perron, Jean-Marie Lafleur (1902-1985) et Louis-NapolÃ©on Audet (1881-1971). L'artiste Guido Nincheri rÃ©alise trois sÃ©ries de verriÃ¨res pour ce projet. Par ailleurs, la statue de sainte CÃ©cile et les portes en bronze, reprÃ©sentant des Ã©vÃ©nements de la vie du Christ, sont l'oeuvre d'Albert Gilles. \n\nAu cours de la seconde moitiÃ© de la dÃ©cennie 1950, d'autres travaux sont effectuÃ©s dans l'arrondissement institutionnel de la paroisse de Sainte-CÃ©cile. D'abord, le couvent des soeurs des Saints-Noms-de-JÃ©sus-et-de-Marie est agrandi selon les plans de Jean-Marie Lafleur. Une chapelle et un auditorium sont notamment ajoutÃ©s. Puis, en 1957, Henri Sicotte-Labelle participe une autre fois Ã  l'architecture du noyau diocÃ©sain en rÃ©alisant les plans de l'Ã©vÃªchÃ©. \n\nLes soeurs de la Providence quittent en 1979 leur bÃ¢timent alors transformÃ© en rÃ©sidence pour personnes Ã¢gÃ©es autonomes. La cathÃ©drale de Sainte-CÃ©cile est consacrÃ©e en 1985 et elle est dÃ©clarÃ©e basilique mineure par un dÃ©cret du pape Jean-Paul II en 1991.

Les navigateurs et les pÃªcheurs s'installent Ã  proximitÃ© des quais. \n\nLe quai TachÃ© est construit entre 1815 et 1826, sur le site d'un quai plus ancien, par la sociÃ©tÃ© commerciale de Charles (1784-1826) et Jean-Baptiste TachÃ© (1786-1849), membres d'une famille de notables de Kamouraska. SituÃ© en aval du fleuve Saint-Laurent et atteignant une longueur de plus de 158 mÃ¨tres, le quai est Ã©rigÃ© afin de faciliter les Ã©changes commerciaux avec les autres ports du Saint-Laurent et pour abriter les embarcations.\n\nLe quai Miller est Ã©rigÃ© au milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle par le commerÃ§ant Louis Miller, Ã  l'extrÃ©mitÃ© nord d'un terrain lui appartenant. SituÃ© en amont du fleuve Saint-Laurent, le quai mesure environ 97 mÃ¨tres et possÃ¨de une structure composÃ©e de caissons de bois Ã  claire-voie remplis de pierres.\n\nÃ€ l'Ã©poque du transport maritime, les goÃ©lettes de Kamouraska sont rÃ©putÃ©es jusqu'Ã  QuÃ©bec en raison des grandes quantitÃ©s de provisions qu'elles peuvent transporter. Dans la seconde moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle, toutefois, le transport maritime perd de l'importance au profit du transport ferroviaire avec l'ouverture de la ligne de chemin de fer du Grand-Tronc qui atteint Kamouraska et RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup en 1860. Par consÃ©quent, l'utilisation des quais dÃ©croÃ®t et ces derniers servent alors Ã  l'expÃ©dition du bois par goÃ©lettes Ã  moteur puis, au dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, au cabotage.\n\nJusqu'au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1870, le quai TachÃ© demeure la propriÃ©tÃ© de la famille TachÃ©. En 1877, Ã  la suite de difficultÃ©s financiÃ¨res, Louis Miller perd son quai au profit du notaire Polydore Langlais, qui le cÃ¨de au gouvernement canadien en 1884. Le gouvernement canadien acquiert Ã©galement le quai TachÃ© trois ans plus tard et y entreprend d'importants travaux de rÃ©novation. Plusieurs travaux sont aussi effectuÃ©s sur les deux quais dans la premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© du XXe siÃ¨cle. Le quai Miller est dotÃ© d'un hangar en 1925. Le quai TachÃ© est Ã©largi et dotÃ© d'un feu de navigation en 1938 par le ministÃ¨re des Transports du Canada. Au cours du XXe siÃ¨cle, des murs ainsi que des contreforts de bÃ©ton sont installÃ©s afin de renforcer les structures des deux quais.\n\nL'activitÃ© commerciale des quais diminue considÃ©rablement au cours du XXe siÃ¨cle. En raison de son inutilitÃ©, le hangar Ã©rigÃ© sur le quai Miller est dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ© en 1969 au Cap TachÃ©. Puis, au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1980, le feu de navigation du quai TachÃ© disparaÃ®t. Le gouvernement canadien ayant cessÃ© d'entretenir les quais depuis plusieurs annÃ©es, ceux-ci se dÃ©tÃ©riorent rapidement. En 1983, on envisage mÃªme leur dÃ©molition. La municipalitÃ© de Kamouraska les acquiert en 1984.\n\nLes quais de Kamouraska sont constituÃ©s site du patrimoine en 1997. Ce lieu est l'un des plus anciens sites portuaires de la rive sud du fleuve Saint-Laurent. En 2004, la municipalitÃ© procÃ¨de Ã  d'importants travaux de rÃ©fection du quai Miller.

Ce dernier se rÃ©serve une bande de terre sur une pointe s'avanÃ§ant dans le fleuve en bordure de l'anse de Bellechasse. En 1709, il concÃ¨de cette terre Ã  un colon de l'endroit, Jean Fradet. AprÃ¨s le dÃ©cÃ¨s d'Olivier Morel de La Durantaye, la seigneurie est divisÃ©e en deux. Son fils aÃ®nÃ©, Louis-Joseph (1671-1756), hÃ©rite de la moitiÃ© est. Le 18 aoÃ»t 1720, il la vend Ã  Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de ChevriÃ¨res de Saint-Vallier (1653-1727), Ã©vÃªque de QuÃ©bec.

Ce dernier y fait Ã©riger une rÃ©sidence correspondant Ã  la partie est de l'actuelle maison Amos. AprÃ¨s avoir connu diffÃ©rents propriÃ©taires, le domaine est rÃ©quisitionnÃ© en 1809 par Xavier-Roch Tarieu de LanaudiÃ¨re (1771-1813), l'un des coseigneurs de l'endroit. Ce dernier fait Ã©riger une seconde rÃ©sidence dans le prolongement de la premiÃ¨re maison en 1810. Les deux bÃ¢timents sont alors reliÃ©s par un passage couvert. En 1812, il vend la propriÃ©tÃ© Ã  ses soeurs Agathe (1774-1838) et Charlotte-Marguerite (1775-1856) Tarieu de LanaudiÃ¨re. Celles-ci font reconnaÃ®tre la pointe de Saint-Vallier comme propriÃ©tÃ© roturiÃ¨re n'Ã©tant pas incluse dans le domaine seigneurial. En 1856, le petit-neveu de Charlotte-Marguerite, l'avocat John Young (1827-1859), devient propriÃ©taire du domaine. \n\nAu milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle, la rÃ©gion de la CÃ´te-du-Sud devient un lieu de villÃ©giature prisÃ© par les notables de la rÃ©gion de QuÃ©bec. Deux maires de la ville de QuÃ©bec, Thomas Pope (1825-1863) et Charles Joseph Alleyn (1817-1890) deviennent successivement propriÃ©taires du domaine de la pointe de Saint-Vallier en 1860 et 1863. C'est vraisemblablement Ã  cette Ã©poque, entre 1855 et 1865, que les deux rÃ©sidences sont rÃ©unies pour former une seule maison. En 1890, le pÃªcheur et commerÃ§ant Thomas Lemieux devient propriÃ©taire du domaine. Le notaire FÃ©lix-Alphonse LaRue (1862-1925) acquiert la propriÃ©tÃ© en 1906. Le terrain sur lequel s'Ã©lÃ¨ve la grange est alors intÃ©grÃ© au domaine. Le notaire LaRue fait construire deux annexes implantÃ©es perpendiculairement au mur nord de la maison. L'une sert de cuisine d'Ã©tÃ© et l'autre accueille une chapelle privÃ©e. C'est probablement Ã  cette Ã©poque que des lucarnes sont percÃ©es dans le versant sud du toit. Une vaste terrasse en pierre est Ã©galement Ã©rigÃ©e de 1908 Ã  1910 sur la pointe de Saint-Vallier. Le domaine est revendu en 1912 Ã  l'homme d'affaires Thomas DuchaÃ®ne (1849-1938) qui le vend Ã  son fils Alexandre trois ans plus tard. \n\nEn 1923, Mathilde Beaudry (1882-1948), Ã©pouse d'Arthur Amos (1874-1950), acquiert la propriÃ©tÃ©. Le domaine est alors nommÃ© Murval. La famille Amos effectue des travaux sur la rÃ©sidence. La faÃ§ade sud est dotÃ©e d'une galerie couverte et une vÃ©randa est ajoutÃ©e Ã  son extrÃ©mitÃ©.

La seigneurie de Rimouski est d'abord concÃ©dÃ©e en 1688 Ã  Augustin Rouer de la CardonniÃ¨re (1664-vers 1711). Elle n'est toutefois occupÃ©e qu'Ã  partir de 1696 par RenÃ© Lepage de Sainte-Claire (1656-1718). En effet, ce dernier fait l'Ã©change de sa propriÃ©tÃ© de l'Ã®le d'OrlÃ©ans contre la seigneurie. Le nouveau seigneur s'installe Ã  l'est de la riviÃ¨re Rimouski; cependant, sa seigneurie est situÃ©e Ã  l'ouest du cours d'eau. Le relief et la qualitÃ© des terres motivent le choix du seigneur pour l'Ã©tablissement initial de son domaine et des premiers colons.\n\nEn 1711, Lepage de Sainte-Claire Ã©tablit son fils Pierre Lepage de Saint-BarnabÃ© (1687-1754) sur une terre en bordure de la riviÃ¨re Rimouski. En 1751, ce dernier fait officiellement reconnaÃ®tre ses droits sur la seigneurie de Saint-BarnabÃ©, qui comprend le territoire situÃ© entre la riviÃ¨re Rimouski et la Pointe-au-PÃ¨re, Ã  l'est. La prÃ©sence de la riviÃ¨re facilite l'exploitation des ressources de la rÃ©gion. Les activitÃ©s d'agriculture et de pÃªche, l'exploitation forestiÃ¨re et la traite des fourrures constituent la base de l'Ã©conomie locale. Vers la fin du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle, la seigneurie est divisÃ©e entre les nombreux hÃ©ritiers. Certains d'entre eux contractent des dettes envers le marchand Joseph Drapeau (1752-1810), de QuÃ©bec. Ã€ partir de 1790, ce dernier rachÃ¨te les parts de ses dÃ©biteurs et devient ainsi propriÃ©taire du domaine. Il s'occupe des affaires de la seigneurie jusqu'Ã  sa mort. Ses filles, Luce-Gertrude (1794-1880), Marie-AdÃ©laÃ¯de (1796-1869) et Louise-AngÃ¨le (1799-1876) prennent la relÃ¨ve. Elles construisent en 1847 un nouveau manoir au nord de l'ancien.\n\nL'endroit se dÃ©veloppe rapidement Ã  la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Les terrains de la rue Saint-Germain, situÃ©s en bordure de la riviÃ¨re et du fleuve, attirent l'Ã©lite rimouskoise qui y fait construire plusieurs rÃ©sidences. \n\nEn 1950, un incendie se dÃ©clare dans la cour Ã  bois de la compagnie Price Brothers et les vents violents le propagent jusque sur la rive opposÃ©e. Le tiers de la ville est alors dÃ©truit. La plupart des maisons situÃ©es prÃ¨s de la riviÃ¨re disparaissent, notamment l'ancien manoir seigneurial. Quelques maisons bourgeoises sont Ã©pargnÃ©es, dont le chÃ¢teau Rouleau (1895) et les maisons Caron (1927 ou 1928), DubÃ© (1945), Marmen et McKinnon (vers 1900), notamment grÃ¢ce Ã  leur couverture en tÃ´le. \n\nLe secteur est reconstruit selon les styles architecturaux et les nouveaux principes de l'urbanisme du milieu du XXe siÃ¨cle.

DÃ¨s 1692, les premiers colons s'Ã©tablissent dans la seigneurie de Kamouraska, formant ainsi un noyau villageois.

Les soeurs de la congrÃ©gation de Notre-Dame accompagnent les Sulpiciens dans l'Ã©tablissement de la mission, qui n'occupe qu'une petite partie de la seigneurie. \n\nUne chapelle en bois, probablement transportÃ©e du Sault-au-RÃ©collet, est implantÃ©e sur un premier lieu d'Ã©tablissement en 1721. La mission est dÃ©placÃ©e quelques annÃ©es plus tard pour occuper un emplacement stratÃ©gique Ã  l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re des Outaouais. Un fort ainsi que des bÃ¢timents religieux et rÃ©sidentiels sont Ã©rigÃ©s. Un premier presbytÃ¨re est construit en 1731, tandis qu'une Ã©glise en pierre est Ã©levÃ©e l'annÃ©e suivante. Un couvent est bÃ¢ti pour les soeurs de la congrÃ©gation de Notre-Dame en 1735. Les AmÃ©rindiens s'Ã©tablissent aux abords de ce noyau religieux. L'augmentation de la population commence Ã  la fin du XVIIIe avec l'arrivÃ©e de colons. Cette nouvelle population blanche se fait accorder les meilleures terres, ce qui engendre des tensions. Au cours de la seconde moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle, les AmÃ©rindiens quittent Oka en grand nombre.\n\nLa paroisse de l'Annonciation est Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement en 1874. La municipalitÃ© est crÃ©Ã©e l'annÃ©e suivante. C'est Ã  partir de ce moment que l'ensemble bÃ¢ti actuel prend forme. En 1877, un feu ravage le fort, l'Ã©glise, le presbytÃ¨re et d'autres bÃ¢timents Ã  proximitÃ©. La maison curiale est reconstruite la mÃªme annÃ©e. Un nouveau lieu de culte est Ã©levÃ© de 1879 Ã  1883, Ã  quelques pas des fondations de l'ancienne Ã©glise. Les travaux sont dirigÃ©s par les architectes Maurice Perreault (1857-1909) et Albert Mesnard (1847-1909). En 1884, le couvent est dÃ©moli. Un nouveau bÃ¢timent le remplace l'annÃ©e suivante. Un quai est amÃ©nagÃ© probablement en 1884 sur la rive du lac, prÃ¨s de l'Ã©glise. Le tourisme se dÃ©veloppe au cours de cette pÃ©riode. Les bateaux Ã  vapeur transportent de nombreux vacanciers et des pÃ¨lerins vers le quai d'Oka. Le calvaire d'Oka, Ã©rigÃ© vers le milieu du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle et situÃ© sur une colline au nord du site, devient vers la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle un lieu de pÃ¨lerinage populaire. Le quai sert aussi aux dÃ©placements des villageois qui prÃ©fÃ¨rent longtemps ce mode de transport aux routes terrestres en mauvais Ã©tat. \n\nAu cours du XXe siÃ¨cle, le noyau institutionnel d'Oka se consolide. Le clocher de l'Ã©glise est achevÃ© en 1907. Le lieu de culte est agrandi par une chapelle bÃ¢tie de 1907 Ã  1909. Le presbytÃ¨re est incendiÃ© Ã  nouveau en 1922 et reconstruit l'annÃ©e suivante. Les fondations de l'ancienne maison curiale servent Ã  la construction du nouveau bÃ¢timent, lÃ©gÃ¨rement plus court. Ce dernier est dotÃ© d'un toit mansardÃ©, comme le prÃ©cÃ©dent. La congrÃ©gation de Notre-Dame quitte le couvent en 1936. L'immeuble sert aux fins d'enseignement pendant encore plusieurs annÃ©es. \n\nDiffÃ©rents Ã©quipements municipaux sont rÃ©alisÃ©s. La salle de loisirs est construite par les citoyens, probablement au cours du XXe siÃ¨cle. Le quai est acquis par la municipalitÃ© d'Oka en 1960 et fait l'objet de rÃ©novations par la suite. La municipalitÃ© achÃ¨te Ã©galement le couvent en 1980 et le reconvertit en mairie. \n\nLe site du patrimoine d'Oka est constituÃ© en 2001.

Ã€ la mÃªme Ã©poque, un moulin Ã  farine, connu aujourd'hui sous le nom de moulin Riverin, est construit en face de cette scierie. Au dÃ©cÃ¨s de McLeod, cette derniÃ¨re devient la propriÃ©tÃ© de William Price (1789-1867). L'entreprise connaÃ®t une grande expansion, ce qui contribue Ã  faire de Chicoutimi un centre industriel de premier plan au Saguenay. La Price Brothers and Company possÃ¨de alors le monopole de l'industrie du bois dans la localitÃ©. La construction de deux usines de la Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi en 1897 et 1903 et leur agrandissement en 1913 et 1920 confirment la vocation industrielle du secteur.

Le quartier est progressivement dÃ©laissÃ© cependant aprÃ¨s la fermeture des usines en 1930. \n\nEn juillet 1996, des pluies diluviennes provoquent de nombreuses inondations dans la rÃ©gion du Saguenay et entraÃ®nent de forts glissements de terrain.

Ce n'est toutefois pas avant le dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle que la population devient assez nombreuse pour justifier la construction d'une Ã©glise. \n\nL'histoire du site du patrimoine de l'Ã‰glise-et-du-PresbytÃ¨re-de-Saint-Jean-Chrysostome s'amorce avec la construction en 1829 d'un premier presbytÃ¨re, qui sert Ã©galement de chapelle. Le presbytÃ¨re-chapelle est une adaptation de celui de Saint-Anselme de Dorchester, conÃ§u la mÃªme annÃ©e par l'abbÃ© JÃ©rÃ´me Demers (1774-1853) et l'architecte Thomas BaillairgÃ© (1791-1859).

La construction du temple est retardÃ©e et ne s'amorce qu'en 1848, pour se terminer deux ans plus tard. BaillairgÃ© s'Ã©tant retirÃ© de la profession, la fabrique demande alors Ã  Thomas Fournier, Ã©lÃ¨ve de Thomas BaillairgÃ©, de revoir les plans. Les ajustements de Fournier auraient annihilÃ© tous les effets de dÃ©cor en plus de remplacer, en certains endroits, l'arc en plein cintre propre Ã  BaillairgÃ© pour un arc en anse de panier.

DÃ¨s 1873, elle est l'une des premiÃ¨res Ã  produire le Â« Dualin Â», un puissant explosif Ã  base de nitroglycÃ©rine. En 1877, l'usine devient la Â« Hamilton Powder Co.

En 1860, Hugh McDonald, commerÃ§ant de bois Ã  RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, acquiert plusieurs lots ainsi que les droits de coupe sur un vaste territoire. En 1862, aprÃ¨s l'Ã©chec d'une drave, il vend toutes ses propriÃ©tÃ©s Ã  Charles King (dÃ©cÃ©dÃ© en 1876), homme d'affaires de Lyster d'origine britannique. Ce dernier confie la gestion du moulin Ã  scie de Saint-PacÃ´me Ã  son fils, Edmund King (vers 1835-1905). Un second noyau de population se forme alors Ã  Saint-PacÃ´me, sur la rive ouest de la riviÃ¨re Ouelle, Ã  proximitÃ© du moulin Ã  scie. Le dÃ©veloppement de l'industrie forestiÃ¨re entraÃ®ne l'Ã©tablissement d'autres familles anglophones, gÃ©nÃ©ralement de foi anglicane, notamment les Harding. La famille King demeure propriÃ©taire du moulin Ã  scie de Saint-PacÃ´me et des droits de coupe dans la rÃ©gion jusqu'en 1903. Ses propriÃ©tÃ©s sont alors vendues Ã  la River Ouelle Pulp and Lumber Company.\n\nLa mÃªme annÃ©e, Edmund King se fait construire une villa sur le domaine familial. Son fils Sydney (1881-1946) fait de mÃªme. Les deux rÃ©sidences sont Ã  proximitÃ© l'une de l'autre. La construction de cette derniÃ¨re se termine en 1904. Les deux villas sont agrandies et transformÃ©es en 1912 et 1913. En 1924, au dÃ©cÃ¨s de la veuve d'Edmund, Marie-Julienne Courcy (1845-1924), leur fille Ida (1890-1961) s'installe avec son Ã©poux, Harold Alfred Harding (1883-1973), dans la demeure d'Edmund King. En 1925, un tremblement de terre endommage quatre des cinq foyers de la rÃ©sidence de Sydney King. Ils sont dÃ©molis par la suite. \n\nPlusieurs dÃ©pendances sont Ã©galement construites prÃ¨s des villas, dont un garage, un hangar Ã  voitures Ã  chevaux, une Ã©curie et une maison pour les domestiques. Un cimetiÃ¨re familial est Ã©galement amÃ©nagÃ© Ã  l'extrÃ©mitÃ© ouest du domaine pour recevoir les dÃ©pouilles des membres des familles King et Harding. L'autorisation de crÃ©er ce lieu de sÃ©pulture est donnÃ©e en aoÃ»t 1919 par le Conseil supÃ©rieur d'hygiÃ¨ne de la province de QuÃ©bec. Il est divisÃ© en deux sections, la partie ouest Ã©tant rÃ©servÃ©e Ã  la famille Harding et la partie est, aux King. Cette deuxiÃ¨me section est elle-mÃªme divisÃ©e en deux, une moitiÃ© Ã©tant rÃ©servÃ©e aux catholiques et l'autre moitiÃ© aux anglicans. Au fil des ans, sept stÃ¨les sont dressÃ©es dans la section des King et six monuments identiques sont Ã©rigÃ©s du cÃ´tÃ© des Harding.

Pendant plusieurs annÃ©es, les colons doivent se rendre Ã  Kamouraska pour les services religieux. Une premiÃ¨re chapelle en bois est construite pour les rÃ©sidents de Saint-AndrÃ© en 1790, soit en mÃªme temps que la bÃ©nÃ©diction du cimetiÃ¨re. L'annÃ©e suivante, la paroisse est Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement et les registres sont ouverts. En 1803, les paroissiens demandent Ã  l'Ã©vÃªque de QuÃ©bec la permission d'entreprendre la construction d'une Ã©glise en pierre. Les travaux commencent deux ans plus tard, au sud de la chapelle. Benoni Martin de Kamouraska et FranÃ§ois-Xavier Boucher de RiviÃ¨re-Ouelle, maÃ®tres charpentiers et menuisiers, sont engagÃ©s. Le prÃªtre desservant, ThÃ©odore LÃ©tang (1773-1838), bÃ©nit l'Ã©glise actuelle de la paroisse de Saint-AndrÃ© en 1811. \n\nEn 1822, une sacristie extÃ©rieure est ajoutÃ©e au chevet de l'Ã©glise.

La construction d'une salle publique est rÃ©alisÃ©e en 1866 par Joseph Morin et Ã‰tienne Pelletier. DÃ¨s l'automne, les conseillers y tiennent leurs sÃ©ances. Vingt ans plus tard, un couvent, construit par le marchand Pierre-Hilary Michaud, s'ajoute au noyau Ã  proximitÃ© du presbytÃ¨re. Des travaux sont faits Ã  la salle publique en 1902. Elle continue de disposer d'une salle pour les hommes et d'une pour les femmes. L'endroit comprend Ã©galement une salle pour les rÃ©unions du conseil municipal et un logement pour le bedeau.

NÃ© Ã  Beloeil, Champeaux est ordonnÃ© prÃªtre en 1847. Il est affectÃ© comme missionnaire dans les Cantons-de-l'Est. En 1857, il est nommÃ© curÃ© de Saint-Michel-de-Napierville. Champeaux fait construire la premiÃ¨re chapelle de Saint-Venant en 1863. Avec ses demi-frÃ¨res Flavien et EusÃ¨be-Henri Paquette, il achÃ¨te des terres dans le canton de Hereford, procÃ¨de Ã  leur dÃ©frichement et finance la construction d'une scierie. Quelques familles francophones et catholiques venues de la vallÃ©e du Richelieu s'installent Ã  Saint-Venant. Les plus anciennes traces d'inhumation subsistant dans le cimetiÃ¨re remontent Ã  1873, l'annÃ©e suivant l'Ã©rection canonique de la paroisse. \n\nVers 1875, le village de Saint-Venant entre dans une Ã¨re de prospÃ©ritÃ©, grÃ¢ce Ã  la vigueur de l'industrie forestiÃ¨re et Ã  la construction d'une gare par la compagnie ferroviaire Hereford Railway en 1889. Saint-Venant compte alors une scierie, une forge, un magasin gÃ©nÃ©ral et un bureau de poste. \n\nLa construction de l'Ã©glise de Saint-Venant commence en 1875 et se termine en 1877. Wolfred Lussier (1841-1883), le curÃ© de la paroisse, est dÃ©lÃ©guÃ© par l'Ã©vÃªque de Sherbrooke, monseigneur Antoine Racine (1822-1893) pour la construction de l'Ã©glise. Cette derniÃ¨re est vraisemblablement Ã©rigÃ©e par corvÃ©e. L'Ã©glise de Saint-Venant est un bon exemple d'utilisation de motifs tirÃ©s du style nÃ©ogothique dans l'architecture religieuse catholique. Ce style est souvent utilisÃ© dans l'Ã©dification des lieux de culte de diffÃ©rentes traditions religieuses au milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle. L'Ã‰glise catholique quÃ©bÃ©coise a parfois recours aux formes nÃ©ogothiques dans la deuxiÃ¨me moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle. \n\nEn 1880, le clocher de l'Ã©glise de Saint-Venant est construit tout en agrandissant l'Ã©glise par la faÃ§ade. En 1897, l'intÃ©rieur est achevÃ© et l'architecte Jean-Baptiste Verret (1867-1903) en rÃ©alise le dÃ©cor. Verret, originaire de Lorette, reÃ§oit sa formation auprÃ¨s de FranÃ§ois-Xavier Berlinguet (1830-1916). En 1893, Verret s'installe Ã  Sherbrooke et conÃ§oit plusieurs Ã©glises du diocÃ¨se, dont celle de Saint-Patrice Ã  Magog (1894), de Saint-Adolphe Ã  Dudswell (1897-1899), de Saint-HermÃ©nÃ©gilde (1898-1899), de Sainte-CÃ©cile Ã  Whitton (1901) et de Saint-Hippolyte Ã  Wotton (1902). Cet architecte reconstruit aussi le corps principal du SÃ©minaire de Sherbrooke, dont la partie la plus Ã©levÃ©e, la tour centrale, fait huit Ã©tages, en 1899. Il rÃ©alise aussi les plans de l'Ã©vÃªchÃ© de Rimouski. \n\nLe dÃ©cor intÃ©rieur de l'Ã©glise, d'une grande qualitÃ©, est rÃ©alisÃ© avec sept essences de bois locales, coupÃ©es sur les terres des paroissiens. Les lattes de bois sont vernies, non peintes, fait exceptionnel dans l'architecture religieuse catholique quÃ©bÃ©coise. Les tribunes ceinturant entiÃ¨rement le lieu de culte constituent aussi un Ã©lÃ©ment rare.\n\nDÃ¨s 1900, le Conseil d'hygiÃ¨ne de la province de QuÃ©bec exige la fermeture du cimetiÃ¨re situÃ© derriÃ¨re l'Ã©glise, car les eaux de ruissellement du cimetiÃ¨re se dirigent vers un couvent. Cette situation accroÃ®t les risques de maladies pour ses occupants. Le site du nouveau cimetiÃ¨re n'est toutefois choisi qu'en 1930. Le nouveau lieu d'inhumation, situÃ© au sud de l'Ã©glise et du presbytÃ¨re, est bÃ©ni en 1935.\n\nEn 1984, le musÃ©e d'arts et d'objets religieux est ouvert dans les tribunes de l'Ã©glise.

L'objectif de Dubuc est de construire sur place une usine de pÃ¢te Ã  papier alimentant directement le marchÃ© europÃ©en. Ã€ cette fin, il fonde en 1916, avec des associÃ©s, la sociÃ©tÃ© The Ha! Ha! Bay Sulphite Company Limited. Le mandat de la compagnie ne se limite pas au commerce et Ã  la transformation du bois. Elle compte aussi construire des maisons pour les ouvriers, une tÃ¢che qu'elle confie Ã  la SociÃ©tÃ© de construction ouvriÃ¨re. Ainsi, une ville de compagnie voit le jour.\n\nLa construction de l'usine de pÃ¢te chimique, essentielle Ã  la fabrication du papier, commence en 1916 et se termine vers la fin de l'annÃ©e 1917. En 1918 et 1919, une chapelle en bois, un presbytÃ¨re et une premiÃ¨re Ã©cole sont Ã©rigÃ©s.

Celle-ci s'implante Ã  partir de 1902 Ã  l'Anse-Ã -Benjamin pour alimenter en matiÃ¨re ligneuse son moulin de pÃ¢te chimique de Fulton dans l'Ã‰tat de New York. L'entreprise reprend les terrains des frÃ¨res Nordin, deux SuÃ©dois, qui tentent sans succÃ¨s d'implanter une scierie et un Ã©corceur sur le site. La Battle Island Paper Company y fait alors construire un vÃ©ritable petit complexe usinier. Il comprend, entre autres, un monte-billes, une scierie, trois chaudiÃ¨res, un incinÃ©rateur pour les rÃ©sidus des Ã©corces, des convoyeurs pour l'entreposage et la manutention des billes de bois ainsi que trois quais d'expÃ©dition et un de charbon. De plus, le site inclut un bÃ¢timent principal pour loger 22 Ã©corceurs et un atelier de mÃ©canique.\n\nD'une envergure considÃ©rable, ce complexe usinier reprÃ©sente le premier investissement industriel d'importance Ã  la baie des Ha! Ha! Plusieurs raisons justifient le choix de cet emplacement : la proximitÃ© des matiÃ¨res premiÃ¨res, les installations de navigation et d'expÃ©dition, l'abondance et la disponibilitÃ© de la main-d'oeuvre. Entre 1902 et 1914, la compagnie emploie jusqu'Ã  trois cents hommes annuellement. Leurs salaires, parmi les plus Ã©levÃ©s du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Ã  l'Ã©poque, contribuent Ã  assurer le roulement et l'essor de l'Ã©conomie locale. Le bois est coupÃ© pour l'essentiel dans les cantons de Ferland et de Boileau et Ã©corcÃ© sur place. Il est transportÃ© toutes les deux semaines par bateau aux usines de pÃ¢tes et papiers de l'Ontario et du nord-est des Ã‰tats-Unis. \n\nEn 1910, le gouvernement du QuÃ©bec adopte une loi limitant l'exportation du bois de papeterie quÃ©bÃ©cois non transformÃ©. Cette mesure a comme principale consÃ©quence d'augmenter le coÃ»t des droits de coupe. En 1914, la Battle Island Paper Company est mise en faillite. Son usine cesse ses activitÃ©s entre 1915 et 1917, puis est dÃ©mantelÃ©e. En 1917, la Compagnie de pulpe de Chicoutimi, dirigÃ©e par Jules-Ã‰douard-Alfred Dubuc (1871-1947), rÃ©cupÃ¨re les droits de coupe du site. Cette transaction lui permet de lancer son projet d'usine de pÃ¢te chimique, la Ha! Ha! Bay Sulfite Company Limited. La construction d'une importante usine, convertie en papeterie en 1926, entraÃ®ne la crÃ©ation de la ville de Port-Alfred en 1919. La ville est conÃ§ue pour loger les cadres et les ouvriers Ã  proximitÃ© des installations.

La vallÃ©e du Saint-Laurent est alors le territoire privilÃ©giÃ© des Iroquoiens, AmÃ©rindiens d'un mÃªme groupe linguistique ayant adoptÃ© des traits culturels communs, dont la sÃ©dentarisation et la culture de plantes domestiquÃ©es. Les Iroquoiens du Saint-Laurent forment un ensemble culturel distinct avec ses propres caractÃ©ristiques identitaires. Cet ensemble culturel est lui-mÃªme divisÃ© en diffÃ©rents sous-groupes et la rÃ©gion de Saint-Anicet semble correspondre Ã  l'un d'eux.\n\nRemontant au XIVe siÃ¨cle de notre Ã¨re, les premiers Iroquoiens de la rÃ©gion de Saint-Anicet pratiquent une horticulture encore embryonnaire, qui ne constitue qu'un Ã©lÃ©ment d'appoint dans leur alimentation. La situation Ã©volue rapidement et la culture des plantes occupe une part de plus en plus importante dans les activitÃ©s de subsistance. Les surplus rÃ©coltÃ©s favorisent une expansion dÃ©mographique rapide entraÃ®nant la multiplication des villages. \n\nLe village est fondÃ© vraisemblablement vers 1450 par des communautÃ©s iroquoiennes s'Ã©tant regroupÃ©es. LocalisÃ© sur un coteau rocailleux non loin de la riviÃ¨re La Guerre et enceint vraisemblablement d'une palissade de bois, ce village regroupe environ 400 personnes. Celles-ci vivent dans une quinzaine de maisons longues, grandes habitations construites de perches de bois et recouvertes d'Ã©corce. Ã€ l'intÃ©rieur y sont alignÃ©s des foyers autour desquels se concentrent les activitÃ©s domestiques des familles habitant les maisons. \n\nLes Iroquoiens formaient une sociÃ©tÃ© matriarcale. La lignÃ©e se transmettait par la mÃ¨re (systÃ¨me matrilinÃ©aire) et lors des mariages, les hommes devaient quitter leur clan pour vivre dans celui de leur femme (systÃ¨me matrilocal). Les activitÃ©s horticoles, la cueillette des plantes sauvages et la fabrication des vases en cÃ©ramique sont l'affaire des femmes, tandis que la chasse, la pÃªche et les Ã©changes occupent les hommes.\n\nLes habitants ont dÃ©veloppÃ© un trÃ¨s haut niveau d'exploitation des ressources horticoles. En effet, non seulement les grains de maÃ¯s sont plus gros et plus abondants qu'ailleurs, mais pour la premiÃ¨re fois au QuÃ©bec, des graines de courge et de tournesol ont Ã©tÃ© dÃ©couvertes. On estime que les champs en culture ont dÃ» couvrir prÃ¨s de deux kilomÃ¨tres autour du village. Le village Ã©tend Ã©galement son influence au-delÃ  de son enceinte avec l'Ã©tablissement dans la rÃ©gion de sites satellites et de petits hameaux saisonniers exploitant diverses ressources du territoire. L'occupation du site semble avoir perdurÃ© pendant environ vingt ans, durÃ©e inhabituelle pour ce type d'Ã©tablissement qui doit Ãªtre dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ© lorsque les terres environnantes sont appauvries par les cultures intensives. \n\nEn 1826, la dÃ©couverte fortuite d'artefacts amÃ©rindiens dans la rÃ©gion de Saint-Anicet annonce un potentiel qui ne sera rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© rÃ©ellement qu'au siÃ¨cle suivant, Ã  la suite de nombreuses recherches archÃ©ologiques rÃ©alisÃ©es par la MRC du Haut-Saint-Laurent.

La paroisse de Saint-Michel-de-Vaudreuil est fondÃ©e en 1773. \n\nLa maison est construite en 1872 pour LÃ©on Groulx Ã  la pÃ©riphÃ©rie du noyau villageois de Saint-Michel-de-Vaudreuil, sur le rang des Chenaux. Cette voie borde le lac des Deux Montagnes Ã  la rencontre de la riviÃ¨re des Outaouais et du fleuve Saint-Laurent. La parcelle sur laquelle est Ã©tablie la ferme se dÃ©ploie perpendiculairement au cours d'eau. L'implantation de la rÃ©sidence en bordure du chemin Ã©voque le systÃ¨me du rang, ancien mode de division des terres mis en place lors du RÃ©gime franÃ§ais. Sur le site, la grange en bois implantÃ©e en enfilade derriÃ¨re la maison ainsi que le petit poulailler en bois Ã©voquent toujours ce passÃ© agraire. \n\nLa ferme demeure la propriÃ©tÃ© de LÃ©on Groulx jusqu'Ã  son dÃ©cÃ¨s, en 1878, peu de temps aprÃ¨s la naissance de son fils Lionel Groulx (1878-1967). La mÃ¨re de Lionel Groulx, PhilomÃ¨ne Pilon, se remarie rapidement avec Guillaume Ã‰mond qui occupe par la suite la ferme du rang des Chenaux. \n\nLe paysage agraire du rang bordant le lac des Deux Montagnes se transforme progressivement dÃ¨s le dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle. Des notables construisent alors des rÃ©sidences secondaires en bordure de la baie de Vaudreuil, transformant et densifiant la trame bÃ¢tie. Vers 1925, l'accessibilitÃ© du secteur s'amÃ©liore avec la construction des ponts Galipeault et Taschereau qui relient l'Ã®le de MontrÃ©al Ã  la presqu'Ã®le de Vaudreuil-Soulanges. DÃ¨s le milieu du XXe siÃ¨cle, le dÃ©veloppement du rÃ©seau routier entraÃ®ne une transformation rapide du secteur de Vaudreuil. Celui-ci devient peu Ã  peu une banlieue de la rÃ©gion montrÃ©alaise. De nouveaux quartiers rÃ©sidentiels se dressent sur les anciennes terres agricoles transformant ainsi le paysage du secteur. Ã€ sa mort en 1967, Lionel Groulx lÃ¨gue la propriÃ©tÃ© de Vaudreuil Ã  sa niÃ¨ce et collaboratrice, Juliette Lalonde-RÃ©millard.

La vie rurale de son enfance et le travail agricole influencent longtemps l'imaginaire de Groulx. Il est une figure marquante de la vie intellectuelle de son temps. Il est aussi un homme de lettres engagÃ© comme enseignant, historien et polÃ©miste dans les dÃ©bats sur le nationalisme et le fait franÃ§ais. Lionel Groulx Ã©voque dans ses oeuvres, dont Â« Les Rapaillages Â» et ses Â« MÃ©moires Â», plusieurs aspects de son enfance dans le rang des Chenaux Ã  Vaudreuil.

AprÃ¨s avoir Ã©tÃ© licenciÃ©s, ils sont envoyÃ©s par sir Gordon Drummond (1772-1854), administrateur du Bas-Canada, afin d'Ã©tablir un poste militaire agricole prÃ¨s de la riviÃ¨re Saint-FranÃ§ois. DÃ¨s la fondation, la paroisse catholique Saint-FrÃ©dÃ©ric est crÃ©Ã©e alors que la paroisse anglicane Saint-George est constituÃ©e en 1822. L'actuelle Ã©glise Saint-George est Ã©rigÃ©e en 1855-1856 afin de remplacer un premier lieu de culte. En 1861, le bureau d'enregistrement se joint au noyau institutionnel. Un incendie dÃ©truit partiellement l'Ã©glise Saint-George en 1863. Elle est reconstruite Ã  partir de murs subsistants. Au tournant du XXe siÃ¨cle, le presbytÃ¨re de Saint-FrÃ©dÃ©ric et un hÃ´tel des postes sont construits. Le premier hÃ´tel Manoir Drummond s'ajoute Ã  l'ensemble en 1907. Deux ans plus tard, le parc est amÃ©nagÃ© sur un terrain de la fabrique. Il devient un centre nÃ©vralgique de la ville autant pour les activitÃ©s organisÃ©es que pour celles de nature informelle. \n\nÃ€ cette Ã©poque, Drummondville est modeste; elle compte 3 500 habitants et quelques manufactures. L'insuffisance de la force motrice constitue la principale raison freinant la prospÃ©ritÃ© et restreignant le dÃ©veloppement de la ville. Ainsi, en 1913, la fondation de la Southern Canada Power agit comme catalyseur de l'Ã©tablissement d'entreprises manufacturiÃ¨res. Ã€ partir de la PremiÃ¨re Guerre mondiale, une pÃ©riode de croissance Ã©conomique et industrielle s'amorce. DÃ¨s 1915, la Southern Canada Power permet de pourvoir en Ã©nergie les entreprises manufacturiÃ¨res, lesquelles sont de plus en plus nombreuses Ã  venir s'y installer. \n\nCe contexte Ã©conomique incite les banques et les commerces Ã  s'Ã©tablir Ã  Drummondville, diversifiant ainsi les services. DÃ¨s 1916, la Banque Canadienne de Commerce ouvre une succursale Ã  la demande de la Southern Canada Power, et dÃ©mÃ©nage l'annÃ©e suivante autour du parc Saint-FrÃ©dÃ©ric. En 1920, la Southern Canada Power amÃ©nage une salle de montre, le bureau des perceptions des comptes d'Ã©lectricitÃ© et des bureaux pour la direction prÃ¨s de la banque. La mÃªme annÃ©e, la Banque Provinciale fait construire un Ã©difice Ã  proximitÃ©. En 1921, la troisiÃ¨me Ã©glise Saint-FrÃ©dÃ©ric est incendiÃ©e. Les murs et les fondations Ã©tant Ã©pargnÃ©s, la nouvelle Ã©glise est Ã©difiÃ©e Ã  partir de ceux-ci de 1923 Ã  1928. L'amÃ©lioration de l'Ã©conomie locale et la croissance dÃ©mographique entraÃ®nent dans la mÃªme dÃ©cennie l'Ã©tablissement de petits commerces dont la Pharmacie Lafontaine et le Dentiste Lafontaine en 1923.\n\nEn 1927, l'hÃ´tel Manoir Drummond est dÃ©truit par un incendie. Son propriÃ©taire, la Southern Canada Power, le fait reconstruire. La compagnie dÃ©sire un hÃ´tel confortable pour accueillir les dirigeants d'entreprises qu'elle veut convaincre de s'Ã©tablir Ã  Drummondville. Mentionnons que la Banque Royale du Canada y occupe un local pendant environ 60 ans, de mÃªme que la Banque Canadienne Nationale. Au tournant des annÃ©es 1960, le bureau d'enregistrement et l'hÃ´tel des postes sont dÃ©molis. S'amorcent alors des changements dans le paysage du parc Saint-FrÃ©dÃ©ric. En 1987, l'hÃ´tel Manoir Drummond devient un centre d'hÃ©bergement pour retraitÃ©s. L'Ã©glise Saint-George et son terrain sont citÃ©s en 1998. \n\nLe site du patrimoine comprenant l'Ã©glise, le presbytÃ¨re et le parc est constituÃ© en 2002.

La mise en valeur du pouvoir hydraulique de la riviÃ¨re Kamouraska remonte Ã  la construction d'un premier moulin banal Ã  eau, plus en amont, pendant le XVIIIe siÃ¨cle. La riviÃ¨re traverse le territoire en serpentant du sud au nord.\n\nLe moulin Paradis est probablement Ã©difiÃ© durant la deuxiÃ¨me moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Cependant, la date de 1804 est souvent Ã©voquÃ©e. Sa construction s'inscrit dans une pÃ©riode d'augmentation du nombre de moulins Ã  farine, Ã  la suite de l'abolition du rÃ©gime seigneurial en 1854. Plusieurs riverains sont alors tentÃ©s de mettre en valeur le potentiel hydraulique des cours d'eau traversant leur propriÃ©tÃ©. Ils peuvent aussi en tirer profit par la vente de leur bien Ã  des entrepreneurs ou industriels locaux. \n\nEn 1860, Hyppolite Michaud vend Ã  Ã‰douard Pelletier, un habitant de Saint-Roch-des-Aulnaies, une parcelle de terrain en bordure de la riviÃ¨re Kamouraska. Le lot de forme triangulaire de moins d'un arpent se situe dans la paroisse de Saint-Louis-de-Kamouraska. Lors de cette vente, Michaud s'assure du paiement Ã  perpÃ©tuitÃ© d'une rente annuelle pour la place de l'Ã©cluse nÃ©cessaire au fonctionnement du moulin. Le moulin est construit en 1860 et 1861 par des artisans locaux dans ce qui est alors appelÃ© le deuxiÃ¨me rang. Le moulin exploite alors l'Ã©nergie hydraulique de la riviÃ¨re Ã  l'aide d'une grande roue.\n\nEn 1862, des dommages sont causÃ©s au moulin par la crue printaniÃ¨re. En 1863, des travaux de rÃ©fection sont rÃ©alisÃ©s aux installations du moulin et de l'Ã©cluse. Dans les annÃ©es qui suivent, le moulin change de mains Ã  plusieurs reprises. Dans la dÃ©cennie suivant la construction du moulin, le site est enrichi d'une grange, d'une Ã©table, d'un fournil et d'une maison pour le meunier ClÃ©ophas Thibault. \n\nIgnace Michaud, ferblantier de Kamouraska, achÃ¨te le moulin en 1873. La forge a pu Ãªtre construite Ã  la suite de cette transaction. Elle servait alors Ã  l'entretien des marteaux utilisÃ©s pour piquer les meules en pierre du moulin. En 1878, Ã‰douard Pelletier, qui avait lancÃ© la construction du moulin, en rÃ©cupÃ¨re la propriÃ©tÃ© Ã  la suite d'un ordre de la Cour supÃ©rieure de Kamouraska. En 1889, Cyprien BÃ©langer, meunier de Saint-Aubert, fait l'acquisition du moulin. Des travaux sont exÃ©cutÃ©s par LÃ©on Chouinard, le propriÃ©taire suivant. Entre 1890 et 1895, celui-ci remplace la roue par des turbines qui demeurent en service jusqu'Ã  la fin des activitÃ©s du moulin en 1977.\n\nDans les derniÃ¨res annÃ©es du XIXe siÃ¨cle, les frÃ¨res Alphonse et Jean-Baptiste Paradis, dont les terres voisinent le moulin, Ã©changent celles-ci contre le moulin. Le toit Ã  deux versants du moulin est alors remplacÃ© par un toit mansardÃ© augmentant l'espace au niveau des combles. Seul propriÃ©taire Ã  partir de 1897, Jean-Baptiste Paradis s'installe avec sa famille dans la partie est du moulin. Les deux niveaux servent alors de rÃ©sidence jusqu'en 1958. Ã€ cette date, une habitation est construite au sud-est du moulin par Louis-Philippe Paradis. L'ancien logis intÃ©grÃ© au moulin sert alors d'espace pour entreposer le grain. \n\nEn 1950, les meules de pierre sont remplacÃ©es par des moulanges modernes. La forge perd alors sa fonction premiÃ¨re. Au printemps 1977, la crue printaniÃ¨re endommage les structures de contention de l'eau et l'Ã©cluse est emportÃ©e. C'est la fin des activitÃ©s du moulin. Depuis les annÃ©es 1980, un centre d'interprÃ©tation est animÃ© par la famille Paradis. Celle-ci demeure propriÃ©taire des lieux depuis plus de cent ans.

Ce bÃ¢timent est alors caractÃ©ristique des maisons rurales de style Second Empire au tournant du XXe siÃ¨cle. Le second volume est construit ultÃ©rieurement. La maison reste entre les mains des descendants de la famille Denis jusqu'en 1950.\n\nLa maison est achetÃ©e en 1956 par FÃ©lix Leclerc (1914-1988). PoÃ¨te, Ã©crivain, dramaturge et chansonnier quÃ©bÃ©cois de renommÃ©e internationale, Leclerc a profondÃ©ment marquÃ© la scÃ¨ne artistique francophone.

SurnommÃ© Â« le roi de la Gatineau Â», Alonzo Wright est un homme public et un parlementaire qui siÃ¨ge Ã  l'AssemblÃ©e lÃ©gislative de la province du Canada puis Ã  la Chambre des Communes. Il acquiert un vaste domaine vers 1860, soit peu de temps aprÃ¨s son mariage avec Mary Sparks. Cette derniÃ¨re est la fille aÃ®nÃ©e de Nicholas Sparks (1794-1862), un riche et influent propriÃ©taire terrien d'Ottawa. Au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1870, Alonzo Wright fait construire sur son domaine une villa et un ensemble de bÃ¢timents agricoles. La villa est le seul bÃ¢timent qui subsiste de l'Ã©poque des Wright.\n\nEn 1905, le domaine passe aux mains des PÃ¨res du Saint-Esprit (Spiritains) qui viennent de quitter la France pour Ã©chapper aux lois Combes qui retirent aux congrÃ©gations religieuses le droit d'enseigner. C'est dans ce contexte que les Spiritains fondent Ã  Gatineau l'Institut colonial franco-canadien, une Ã©cole d'agriculture destinÃ©e aux immigrÃ©s franÃ§ais. Les Spiritains occupent d'abord l'ancienne villa des Wright. En 1907, ils font construire le bÃ¢timent principal dont les plans ont Ã©tÃ© dessinÃ©s par Charles Brodeur (1871-1936) qui est, Ã  cette Ã©poque, le plus important architecte de Hull et de tout l'ouest du QuÃ©bec. En 1912, l'Institut colonial ferme ses portes et devient le CollÃ¨ge apostolique Saint-Alexandre de la Gatineau, un sÃ©minaire et un collÃ¨ge classique. Ce collÃ¨ge est transformÃ©, en 1967, en Ã©tablissement d'enseignement secondaire privÃ©, soit l'actuel CollÃ¨ge Saint-Alexandre. Le nom du collÃ¨ge a Ã©tÃ© choisi en hommage au prÃ©lat franÃ§ais Alexandre Le Roy (1854-1938), supÃ©rieur gÃ©nÃ©ral des Spiritains de 1896 Ã  1926. Au fil des dÃ©cennies, plusieurs nouvelles ailes sont ajoutÃ©es. La Division des petits (1914) et l'infirmerie (1918) se greffent Ã  la villa Wright. L'aile de la chapelle, aussi conÃ§ue par l'architecte Charles Brodeur, est construite derriÃ¨re le pavillon central en 1926. En 1938, la villa Wright est exhaussÃ©e et son extÃ©rieur est entiÃ¨rement remodelÃ©. En 1954, Ã  la suite de l'incendie de la rÃ©sidence des frÃ¨res, adjacente Ã  la villa Wright, de nouveaux dortoirs et un gymnase sont construits. Un autre pavillon est construit en 1957, et un Ã©tage de classes et de laboratoires est ajoutÃ© en 1959. En 1975, l'ancien grand salon de la villa Wright est restaurÃ©.

C'est lÃ  que Philemon Wright (1760-1839) s'Ã©tablit Ã  1800. Il fonde le village qui sera dÃ©signÃ© sous le nom de Wrightstown (ou Wrightville) jusqu'en 1875, annÃ©e de l'incorporation de la citÃ© de Hull. La communautÃ© se dÃ©veloppe rapidement grÃ¢ce Ã  l'agriculture et au commerce du bois. En 1880, Hull est le troisiÃ¨me centre urbain du QuÃ©bec.\n\nAu cours du XIXe siÃ¨cle, plusieurs incendies menacent le dÃ©veloppement de Hull. Le premier survient peu de temps aprÃ¨s la fondation de Wrightstown, soit en 1808. La conflagration dÃ©truit, entre autres, le moulin Ã  farine et ses rÃ©serves, le moulin Ã  scie ainsi qu'un grand nombre de planches et de madriers. D'autres incendies surviennent en 1869, 1875, 1880 et 1886, causant des dommages considÃ©rables. Toutefois, la plus importante conflagration de l'histoire de Hull a lieu le 26 avril 1900. Le feu a pris naissance dans une maison de la rue ChaudiÃ¨re (actuelle rue Saint-RÃ©dempteur); il se propage rapidement aux rÃ©sidences voisines. En moins de 45 minutes, les flammes ravagent une partie des rues ChaudiÃ¨re, Wright, Wellington et Main (actuelle promenade du Portage). L'incendie n'Ã©pargne pas les industries de la ville et dÃ©truit notamment les cours Ã  bois de la compagnie E. B. Eddy, celles de la Hull Lumber, la manufacture de papier ainsi que l'usine d'allumettes Eddy. Plusieurs commerces et institutions, dont le bureau d'enregistrement, le palais de justice et une partie de la prison, sont Ã©galement touchÃ©s. Le Grand Feu dÃ©truit la moitiÃ© de Hull et une partie d'Ottawa, ce qui reprÃ©sente environ 1300 bÃ¢timents sur une superficie de 111,5 hectares.\n\nAu dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, la reconstruction de la ville s'accompagne d'une importante croissance Ã©conomique stimulÃ©e par la production d'Ã©lectricitÃ© et de pÃ¢tes et papiers. Un grand nombre de commerces, de rÃ©sidences bourgeoises et d'institutions apparaissent alors sur la rue Main (actuelle promenade du Portage). L'un des premiers bÃ¢timents reconstruits Ã  la suite du Grand Feu est l'Ã©glise Saint-James, Ã©rigÃ©e en 1900 et en 1901 dans le style nÃ©ogothique. Au cours des annÃ©es suivantes, plusieurs bÃ¢timents sont construits sur la Main et sur les rues transversales. Ils ont une fonction rÃ©sidentielle, commerciale, institutionnelle ou encore industrielle. On y retrouve notamment la maison Gravelle-Leduc (1905-1906), la Banque de MontrÃ©al (1907), l'Ã©difice Pharand (1907 et 1927), l'Ã©difice de la compagnie Hull Electric (1908), l'Ã©difice Paquin (1929-1930) et le cinÃ©ma Cartier (1936-1937).\n\nLe site du patrimoine du Portage est constituÃ© en 1998.

Le peuplement permanent des lieux s'amorce au tournant du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Philemon Wright (1760-1839) obtient officiellement la concession du canton de Hull en 1806. Il Ã©tablit notamment une ferme en bordure du lac DeschÃªnes. Elle est gÃ©rÃ©e Ã  partir de 1821 par son neveu, Charles Symmes (1798-1868). AprÃ¨s une brouille avec son oncle, Symmes achÃ¨te en 1828 la terre qu'il occupe. Il la fait arpenter et diviser en lots destinÃ©s Ã  la vente.

Le seigneur RenÃ© Lepage de Sainte-Claire (1656-1718) Ã©tablit son domaine seigneurial Ã  l'est de la riviÃ¨re, Ã  proximitÃ© du chemin du Roi. Ã€ la fin du siÃ¨cle suivant, le patrimoine foncier du seigneur Lepage est divisÃ© entre les nombreux hÃ©ritiers. Plusieurs d'entre eux contractent des dettes et doivent vendre leur propriÃ©tÃ©. Ã€ partir de 1790, le marchand Joseph Drapeau (1752-1810), de QuÃ©bec, rachÃ¨te les parts de ses dÃ©biteurs. Quelques hÃ©ritiers conservent nÃ©anmoins des terres dans le secteur.\n\nJusqu'au dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle, le principal axe de communication est le chemin du Roi (devenu la rue Saint-Germain), oÃ¹ s'alignent des rÃ©sidences et des commerces. La zone habitÃ©e se concentre entre la riviÃ¨re Rimouski et l'Ã©glise. L'agglomÃ©ration se prÃ©sente comme un village-rue, amÃ©nagÃ© sans planification prÃ©alable. \n\nAu milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle, Rimouski devient le chef-lieu judiciaire du district du Bas-Saint-Laurent. Louis-Jacques Lepage (1814-1903) possÃ¨de de nombreuses propriÃ©tÃ©s dans le secteur. Il fait construire sa rÃ©sidence sur un coteau, Ã  proximitÃ© de l'emplacement choisi pour le palais de justice, Ã©rigÃ© en 1857. La prÃ©sence de cet Ã©difice fait augmenter la valeur des terrains environnants. Voyant les possibilitÃ©s de dÃ©veloppement, Lepage morcelle sa propriÃ©tÃ© Ã  partir de 1858. Chaque fois qu'il vend un terrain, il rÃ©serve une bande de terre large d'environ huit mÃ¨tres en prÃ©vision de l'ouverture de nouvelles rues. Le secteur regroupe alors des boutiques d'artisans et de commerÃ§ants, des bureaux de professionnels, des rÃ©sidences et une place du marchÃ©. \n\nLa trame urbaine s'Ã©tire par la suite vers l'est et le sud. EusÃ¨be Lepage (1813-1888) et le dÃ©putÃ© Joseph-Charles TachÃ© (1820-1894) possÃ¨dent les terrains qui longent le chemin du Roi. Des deux cÃ´tÃ©s de la voie publique, leurs propriÃ©tÃ©s sont divisÃ©es et vendues pour permettre l'Ã©tablissement de commerces et de rÃ©sidences. Au sud, le passage du chemin de fer Intercolonial, Ã  partir de 1873, accÃ©lÃ¨re le rythme du dÃ©veloppement urbain. La rue de la Station (devenue rue de l'Ã‰vÃªchÃ©) attire des commerces et des hÃ´tels qui accueillent les voyageurs. \n\nAu tournant du XXe siÃ¨cle, les professionnels et l'Ã©lite marchande se font construire des rÃ©sidences sur les terrains surÃ©levÃ©s qui surplombent une partie de la ville. Parmi ces rÃ©sidents se trouve notamment l'homme d'affaires et financier Jules-A. Brillant (1889-1973). Brillant participe au dÃ©veloppement Ã©conomique et social de la ville de Rimouski. Il fonde et dirige plusieurs entreprises Ã©tablies dans le quartier Saint-Germain. En 1927, il crÃ©e la Compagnie de TÃ©lÃ©phone nationale et ouvre dix ans plus tard la premiÃ¨re station de radio de Rimouski, CJBR.

Le peuplement du territoire de cette ville, anciennement nommÃ©e CascapÃ©dia, remonte Ã  1697; c'est l'annÃ©e oÃ¹ la seigneurie de Bonaventure est concÃ©dÃ©e. Ã€ compter de 1756, plusieurs Acadiens, victimes du Grand DÃ©rangement, s'installent Ã  l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re CascapÃ©dia. Ils sont suivis, aprÃ¨s la ConquÃªte, par des Ã‰cossais et des Irlandais, puis par des Loyalistes qui s'Ã©tablissent dans le secteur en 1784. \n\nÃ€ la fin du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle, la population de New Richmond est surtout anglophone et d'origine Ã©cossaise. Au cours du siÃ¨cle suivant, de plus en plus de Canadiens franÃ§ais s'installent Ã  New Richmond. Ils cohabitent avec les rÃ©sidents d'origine britannique qui comptent toujours pour 60 pour cent de la population de la localitÃ© en 1871.\n\nLa population de New Richmond s'est regroupÃ©e en diffÃ©rentes agglomÃ©rations au fil des ans. Le secteur de New Richmond Centre, oÃ¹ se trouve le site du patrimoine, est une des plus vieilles agglomÃ©rations de la ville. DÃ¨s le dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle, une chapelle catholique en bois y est construite afin de desservir les francophones de la rÃ©gion. En 1860, l'Ã©vÃªque de QuÃ©bec Ã©rige canoniquement la paroisse des Saints-Anges-Gardiens-de-CascapÃ©dia, en mÃªme temps que treize autres paroisses situÃ©es en GaspÃ©sie. Celle-ci est renommÃ©e ultÃ©rieurement Notre-Dame-des-Saints-Anges. Ã€ cette Ã©poque, l'accroissement important de la population rend nÃ©cessaire l'Ã©rection d'un nouveau lieu de culte. ImplantÃ© sur son site actuel de 1865 Ã  1870, il favorise le dÃ©veloppement d'un noyau villageois Ã  proximitÃ©. En 1918, un presbytÃ¨re est bÃ¢ti, suivi du couvent Sainte-ThÃ©rÃ¨se vers 1925. Ã€ l'occasion de la restauration du cimetiÃ¨re, un calvaire y est Ã©levÃ© en 1927. \n\nÃ€ nouveau, au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1930, l'Ã©glise paroissiale ne rÃ©pond plus aux besoins de la population toujours grandissante. En 1933, d'importants travaux de rÃ©novation et d'agrandissement sont donc rÃ©alisÃ©s sous la direction de l'architecte Pierre LÃ©vesque (1880-1955). Ainsi, de nouvelles fondations en ciment sont coulÃ©es; un choeur et une sacristie sont ajoutÃ©s, l'intÃ©rieur est entiÃ¨rement rÃ©novÃ© et un parement extÃ©rieur en brique est appliquÃ©. Vers 1938, une salle paroissiale est construite Ã  proximitÃ© du lieu de culte en remplacement de la prÃ©cÃ©dente Ã©difiÃ©e neuf ans plus tÃ´t. Elle est utilisÃ©e pour la projection de films pendant de nombreuses annÃ©es avant d'Ãªtre transformÃ©e en commerce.

Narcisse Bertrand (1828-1874), originaire de L'Isle-Verte, est le fils du seigneur Louis Bertrand (1779-1871), fondateur de la SociÃ©tÃ© d'agriculture du comtÃ© de Rimouski. La famille Bertrand exploite Ã  L'Isle-Verte diverses entreprises, dont un magasin gÃ©nÃ©ral, des scieries et une fonderie. Bertrand exerce son mÃ©tier d'avocat dans cette municipalitÃ©. Vers 1850, il fait Ã©riger une grande demeure sur un promontoire qui domine l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re Verte. En 1853, L'Isle-Verte est dÃ©signÃ©e chef-lieu judiciaire du comtÃ© de TÃ©miscouata. Les dÃ©libÃ©rations se font dans une rÃ©sidence privÃ©e pendant les sept premiÃ¨res annÃ©es. Narcisse Bertrand s'unit Ã  d'autres notables du milieu pour obtenir la construction d'une cour de circuit, finalement Ã©rigÃ©e en 1859. \n\nSon fils, Joseph TÃªtu-Bertrand (1864-1940), ingÃ©nieur civil Ã  Ottawa, est responsable des quais de la GaspÃ©sie et des Ã®les de la Madeleine. Il reprend la propriÃ©tÃ© de son pÃ¨re et y habite avec son Ã©pouse, sa mÃ¨re et ses neveux. FÃ©ru d'agriculture, il se soucie de la formation agricole des cultivateurs de sa localitÃ©. Ã€ la suite de la crÃ©ation, en 1898, de stations expÃ©rimentales fruitiÃ¨res dans le comtÃ© de Kamouraska, Bertrand demande au ministÃ¨re de l'Agriculture du Canada d'Ã©tablir Ã©galement une station sur son domaine. En 1903, une centaine d'arbres fruitiers, dont des pommiers, des pruniers et des cerisiers, sont plantÃ©s sur sa propriÃ©tÃ©. Ils permettent d'Ã©tudier la rusticitÃ© et la productivitÃ© des variÃ©tÃ©s implantÃ©es. Un puits, abritÃ© sous un appentis, alimente la maison, les dÃ©pendances et le verger. \n\nVers 1916, Joseph TÃªtu-Bertrand fait Ã©riger un belvÃ©dÃ¨re sur le toit de la demeure et y installe son bureau.

En 1805, dans un contexte d'intensification des Ã©changes entre la colonie et la mÃ©tropole, le Bas-Canada met sur pied la Maison de la TrinitÃ© de QuÃ©bec. Cet organisme est chargÃ© de sÃ©curiser la navigation sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent. Il supervise notamment le pilotage et fait placer les bouÃ©es, phares et fanaux nÃ©cessaires Ã  la sÃ©curitÃ© maritime. En 1806, la construction d'un premier phare est entreprise sur le cÃ´tÃ© nord de l'Ã®le Verte. Le maÃ®tre maÃ§on Edward Cannon (1739-1814) est responsable de la tour en maÃ§onnerie. La fabrication de la lanterne en cuivre est confiÃ©e Ã  George Robinson, Ã  Londres. Le systÃ¨me d'Ã©clairage, fonctionnant d'abord Ã  l'huile de phoque ou de baleine, est l'oeuvre d'une autre entreprise londonienne, Brickwood and Daniels. DÃ¨s 1809, le phare est opÃ©rationnel et facilite la navigation dans cette zone caractÃ©risÃ©e par les nombreux rÃ©cifs et les forts courants crÃ©Ã©s par l'embouchure du Saguenay. Le premier gardien, Charles Hambelton (mort en 1827), occupe cette fonction jusqu'Ã  son dÃ©cÃ¨s. Robert Lindsay (vers 1800-1875) lui succÃ¨de alors.\n\nLe phare de l'Ã®le Verte demeure l'unique structure du genre le long du fleuve Saint-Laurent jusqu'en 1830, alors qu'est mis en service le phare de Pointe-des-Monts. Celle de l'Ã®le Verte sert vraisemblablement de modÃ¨le pour les autres structures construites par la Maison de la TrinitÃ© de QuÃ©bec. En effet, durant la premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle, ce type d'installation est utilisÃ© notamment Ã  Pointe-des-Monts et Ã  l'Ã®le Bicquette (1841). Au fil des dÃ©cennies, plusieurs transformations sont apportÃ©es au phare. En 1850, la maÃ§onnerie est lambrissÃ©e de planches horizontales, crÃ©ant 15 cÃ´tÃ©s de 4 pieds de largeur. Trois ans plus tard, l'huile de phoque servant Ã  chauffer les lampes est remplacÃ©e par un feu Ã  vapeur de pÃ©trole. En 1856, un premier systÃ¨me de signalisation sonore, constituÃ© de canons de brume, est installÃ© pour guider les navires par temps de brouillard. \n\nEn 1867, le fils de Robert Lindsay, Guilbert (mort vers 1891), prend la relÃ¨ve. Il exerce le mÃ©tier de gardien jusqu'en 1888, alors qu'une chute du haut de la tour le laisse invalide. Son fils RenÃ© (1872-1948), Ã¢gÃ© de 16 ans, lui succÃ¨de. En 1894, les canons Ã  brume sont remplacÃ©s par une brimbale composÃ©e d'un mÃ©canisme Ã  bascule et d'une batterie Ã©lectrique. Ce mÃ©canisme provoque la dÃ©tonation de cartouches de dynamite. Le phare est lambrissÃ© de planches verticales en 1904. En 1913, la structure est Ã  nouveau modernisÃ©e. Un manchon en tissu incombustible portÃ© Ã  incandescence sous une trÃ¨s forte chaleur remplace le systÃ¨me d'Ã©clairage prÃ©cÃ©dent. En 1927, Freddy Lindsay (1897-1989) devient le gardien du phare; il occupe cette fonction pendant 37 ans. \n\nEn 1945, une corne de brume remplace la brimbale. En 1960, deux demeures destinÃ©es au gardien et Ã  son assistant sont construites et la vieille rÃ©sidence du gardien est dÃ©molie. L'automatisation complÃ¨te du phare est effectuÃ©e en 1969. Armand Lafrance, dernier gardien de phare de l'Ã®le Verte, quitte ses fonctions en 1972. La mÃªme annÃ©e, un organisme destinÃ© Ã  la protection du phare est formÃ©. En 1974, ce dernier est dÃ©signÃ© Lieu historique national du Canada. En 1982, la municipalitÃ© devient propriÃ©taire de la plupart des bÃ¢timents construits autour du phare.

En 1770, Louis Deschamps (1738-1808) s'Ã©tablit dans cette seigneurie. Il construit vraisemblablement le moulin Ã  scie en 1781. Il s'agit de l'une des premiÃ¨res structures de ce genre sur le territoire de la CÃ´te-du-Sud. Ã€ la suite du blocus continental en 1806, l'Angleterre se tourne vers ses colonies afin de s'approvisionner en bois d'oeuvre. Cette conjoncture Ã©conomique favorise le commerce du bois dans la rÃ©gion et plusieurs moulins sont construits au dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle. En 1808, le moulin Ã  scie est lÃ©guÃ© aux fils de Louis Deschamps. Alexandre Deschamps (1787-1872), avec des membres de sa famille, en assure le fonctionnement jusqu'au milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle. La roue Ã  godets du moulin actionne la scie Ã  chasse et les billots de bois sont transformÃ©s en planches ou en madriers. Une ouverture large, pratiquÃ©e au rez-de-chaussÃ©e, facilite le transport des matÃ©riaux jusqu'Ã  la machinerie.\n\nLa maison du maÃ®tre scieur est probablement construite vers 1870 par Wilbrod Ouellet (1846-1886), originaire de Saint-Pascal et mÃ©canicien de mÃ©tier. Il exploite le moulin Ã  scie jusqu'Ã  son dÃ©cÃ¨s. Le pouvoir hydraulique alimente alors le moulin Ã  scie ainsi qu'une carderie situÃ©e au deuxiÃ¨me Ã©tage. Ã€ la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle, le moulin Ã  scie et Ã  carder passe aux mains du cultivateur Philippe Richard, puis est acquis par NapolÃ©on Laflamme. Ã€ cette Ã©poque, une boutique de forge et de menuiserie succÃ¨de Ã  la carderie et la scie Ã  chasse du moulin est remplacÃ©e par une scie circulaire. L'Ã©tage supÃ©rieur, Ã©clairÃ© par plusieurs ouvertures situÃ©es du cÃ´tÃ© sud, devient un atelier. En 1908, la maison, les dÃ©pendances et le moulin Ã  scie sont vendus Ã  AdÃ©lard Lavoie (1880-1967), originaire de Mont-Carmel. Le moulin fonctionne grÃ¢ce Ã  l'Ã©nergie hydraulique jusqu'en 1965. Louis-Philippe Lavoie, industriel de Saint-Pascal, hÃ©rite de la propriÃ©tÃ© aprÃ¨s le dÃ©cÃ¨s de son pÃ¨re. Le dÃ©bit de la riviÃ¨re n'Ã©tant plus suffisant pour alimenter les Ã©quipements, la roue du moulin est remplacÃ©e par un moteur de camion. La famille Lavoie utilise le moulin jusqu'au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1990. En 2003, la Ville de Saint-Pascal acquiert l'ensemble des bÃ¢timents afin de les restaurer et de les mettre en valeur.

En 1744, PÃ©an fait construire un moulin Ã  eau prÃ¨s du fleuve, au pied de la chute Ã  Maillou. Le fils de PÃ©an, Michel-Jean-Hugues (1723-1774) rend le moulin tristement cÃ©lÃ¨bre. Ayant un sens aigu des affaires, PÃ©an est associÃ© Ã  l'intendant FranÃ§ois Bigot (1703-1778) dans l'approvisionnement des postes de l'Ouest. En 1750, il obtient le contrat de fourniture des farines Ã  l'Ã‰tat et son moulin fait alors des affaires d'or. C'est en effet dans le moulin de PÃ©an qu'est moulue toute la farine et dans ses hangars que celle-ci est blutÃ©e. De lÃ , elle est aussi parfois embarquÃ©e sur les bateaux qui la transportent aux Antilles alors qu'en Nouvelle-France, les blÃ©s rÃ©quisitionnÃ©s par l'Intendant sont interdits de commerce. PÃ©an fait partie du groupe d'entrepreneurs connu sous le nom de la Grande sociÃ©tÃ© qui va monopoliser le commerce en Nouvelle-France Ã  partir de 1756. AprÃ¨s la dÃ©faite, il s'Ã©tablit en France et de tous ceux qui sont accusÃ©s de malversations dans l'administration des affaires du Canada, PÃ©an est celui qui s'en tire le mieux.\n\nSous le RÃ©gime anglais, le moulin PÃ©an devient le moulin banal de la seigneurie de Beaumont. Il est vendu Ã  un particulier en 1862. Au cours des ans, un moulin Ã  scier lui est annexÃ© et un quai, des hangars et des Ã©curies sont construits sur cet emplacement. Le moulin fonctionne jusqu'en 1888 alors que son nouveau propriÃ©taire le dÃ©laisse bientÃ´t pour concentrer ses opÃ©rations dans le moulin construit en haut de la falaise, moulin qui est connu aujourd'hui sous le nom de Â« moulin de Beaumont Â».\n\nEn 1821, les menuisiers et constructeurs de moulins Ã  carde, John Belcher et Ambroise Gendron, du Sault Montmorency, obtiennent le droit d'Ã©riger et de faire fonctionner un moulin Ã  carde sur le ruisseau, au-dessus de la chute au pied de laquelle est situÃ© le moulin Ã  farine de la seigneurie de Beaumont. L'annÃ©e suivante, Belcher rachÃ¨te la part de Gendron. Il fait fonctionner le moulin pendant 11 ans et le revend Ã  Patrick Ryan, de Berthier. Celui-ci exploite le moulin pendant 43 ans. La vente du moulin par la veuve Ryan Ã  Damase BÃ©langer nous apprend que le moulin est alors Ã  carde et aussi Ã  farine. BÃ©langer en est propriÃ©taire de 1876 Ã  1887, annÃ©e oÃ¹ le moulin est rachetÃ© par OnÃ©sime Poulin. L'annÃ©e suivante, Poulin se porte acquÃ©reur du moulin PÃ©an, dont l'activitÃ© semble pÃ©ricliter. Si ce dernier ne moud plus beaucoup de farine, il sert encore de moulin Ã  scie et comporte alors un monte-charge actionnÃ© par la roue du moulin de Beaumont. Poulin dÃ©laisse bientÃ´t les installations du bas de la chute pour concentrer ses opÃ©rations dans le moulin d'en haut. Ce moulin reste dans les mains de la famille Poulin durant 46 ans avant d'Ãªtre achetÃ©, en 1933, par Adjutor Breton. Le moulin sert alors Ã  scier du bois et Ã  prÃ©parer de la moulÃ©e pour nourrir le bÃ©tail.\n\nLe 28 mai 1947, le moulin est acquis par Arthur Labrie (1905-2003). Fils de meunier et lui-mÃªme nÃ© dans un moulin Ã  Saint-Charles-de-Bellechasse, ce visionnaire insuffle une nouvelle vie au moulin de Beaumont. ConsternÃ© par la disparition du patrimoine quÃ©bÃ©cois, il met une vingtaine d'annÃ©es Ã  restaurer le moulin et Ã  mettre son site en valeur, le tout Ã  ses frais. Il devient ainsi l'un des premiers moulins anciens au QuÃ©bec Ã  acquÃ©rir une vocation rÃ©crÃ©otouristique.

Elle demeure la propriÃ©tÃ© de la famille durant trois gÃ©nÃ©rations. Les Fraser construisent vraisemblablement un manoir ainsi qu'un moulin dans le domaine de la seigneurie, cette portion de la concession rÃ©servÃ©e au seigneur. En 1835, AndrÃ© Laughlin Fraser (1800-1877), alors propriÃ©taire de la seigneurie, connaÃ®t des difficultÃ©s financiÃ¨res. Le shÃ©rif de QuÃ©bec vend donc la seigneurie Ã  l'encan. \n\nJohn Saxton Campbell (vers 1787-1855), un riche constructeur de navires de QuÃ©bec, se porte acquÃ©reur de la seigneurie Ã  cette occasion. Il entreprend l'exploitation des ressources hydrauliques et forestiÃ¨res du domaine. \n\nUn manoir destinÃ© Ã  servir de rÃ©sidence pour John Campbell et son Ã©pouse est implantÃ© en 1835 sur les fondations du manoir Fraser. La construction du bÃ¢timent est confiÃ©e Ã  Charles Touchette (1804-1878), un entrepreneur de la rÃ©gion de QuÃ©bec. Le manoir adopte les principes esthÃ©tiques du mouvement pittoresque anglais. Celui-ci  favorise un rapport Ã©troit entre l'architecture et la nature. Cette volontÃ© se manifeste notamment par la prÃ©sence d'Ã©lÃ©ments architecturaux permettant aux rÃ©sidents de jouir du paysage environnant. Ils comprennent une terrasse faÃ®tiÃ¨re, plusieurs portes-fenÃªtres et une galerie qui ceinture le bÃ¢timent. Des trottoirs de bois sur des fondations de pierre jalonnent aussi une partie du terrain sur la falaise oÃ¹ est construit le manoir. \n\nCampbell dÃ©molit le deuxiÃ¨me moulin banal et en construit un autre servant Ã  la fois de moulin banal, de cardage de la laine et de moulin Ã  scie. Il fait Ã©galement construire la maison des invitÃ©s, la maison des serviteurs, la glaciÃ¨re, les latrines extÃ©rieures, l'Ã©curie. Il y ajoute aussi treize autres bÃ¢timents devant servir de rÃ©sidences pour une partie des ouvriers du chantier maritime. Il construit un barrage sur le ruisseau du Petit Sault ainsi que la rampe de dÃ©versoir de l'eau vers la grande roue du moulin. Il complÃ¨te le tout par plusieurs bÃ¢timents sur la rive du fleuve devant servir aux activitÃ©s navales ainsi qu'un quai et d'une mÃ´le Ã  la ligne de marÃ©e basse afin d'accueillir les navires. \n\nPlusieurs employÃ©s travaillent Ã  la construction de navires et de goÃ©lettes au chantier, l'un des quinze chantiers maritimes au QuÃ©bec Ã  l'Ã©poque. La seigneurie et le chantier constituent alors le centre d'un village prospÃ¨re appelÃ© Pointe SÃ¨che. Son dÃ©clin s'amorce avec le dÃ©part de Campbell pour l'Angleterre en 1842. Puis, il se continue par l'arrivÃ©e du chemin de fer reliant l'est de la province Ã  MontrÃ©al au milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Le village de Pointe SÃ¨che est aujourd'hui disparu. \n\nLe manoir est habitÃ© de maniÃ¨re intermittente par la famille Campbell et ses descendants durant plus de 130 ans. Il est surtout utilisÃ© comme rÃ©sidence d'Ã©tÃ© jusqu'en 1968, annÃ©e oÃ¹ le domaine est achetÃ© par un aubergiste de la rÃ©gion. Le sculpteur Jacques Saint-Hilaire en fait ensuite l'acquisition en 1974. \n  \nLe manoir Campbell, la maison des invitÃ©s situÃ©e derriÃ¨re et les vestiges de quelques bÃ¢timents et dÃ©pendances subsistent encore, alors que le moulin et les autres constructions n'y sont plus.\n\nLe domaine de la Seigneurie de l'Islet-du-Portage est constituÃ© en site du patrimoine en 2004.

L'occupation du territoire remonte au dÃ©but du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle, alors que le seigneur RenÃ© Lepage de Sainte-Claire (1656-1718) cÃ¨de un terrain pour la construction de la premiÃ¨re chapelle. Vers 1730, un presbytÃ¨re et un cimetiÃ¨re complÃ¨tent le premier noyau religieux. En 1742, Pierre Lepage de Saint-BarnabÃ© (1687-1754) cÃ¨de Ã  la fabrique tout le territoire compris aujourd'hui entre la rue de la CathÃ©drale et la rue Saint-Louis. Jusqu'au dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle, la principale voie de communication de la seigneurie est le chemin du Roi (devenu plus tard la rue Saint-Germain), oÃ¹ s'alignent des rÃ©sidences et des commerces. L'agglomÃ©ration se prÃ©sente comme un village-rue, formÃ© sans planification prÃ©alable.\n\nLe dÃ©veloppement urbain s'accÃ©lÃ¨re Ã  partir de 1857, alors que Rimouski est choisi pour devenir le chef-lieu judiciaire du district du Bas-Saint-Laurent. L'annonce de la construction du palais de justice incite certains propriÃ©taires Ã  vendre leurs terres et Ã  profiter ainsi du mouvement d'urbanisation. La rue de l'Ã‰glise passe entre les terres qui appartiennent Ã  la fabrique et celles de Louis-Jacques Lepage (1814-1903). Ce dernier morcelle son territoire Ã  partir de 1858. Les rues Saint-Pierre, du MarchÃ© et Saint-Ã‰douard sont alors tracÃ©es. La trame urbaine de Rimouski se dÃ©veloppe rapidement Ã  partir du milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle. En effet, le renforcement du rÃ´le administratif de la ville attire les membres des professions libÃ©rales. \n\nLe noyau religieux est lui aussi en pleine croissance. La construction de l'Ã©glise se termine en 1862, un peu Ã  l'est de l'ancienne Ã©glise. Le lieu de culte devient cathÃ©drale en 1867, alors que Rimouski obtient le siÃ¨ge de l'Ã©vÃªchÃ©. L'ancienne Ã©glise de pierre Ã©tant libre, elle accueille le SÃ©minaire jusqu'Ã  la construction d'un Ã©difice dÃ©diÃ© Ã  cette fonction. Ã€ la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle, la vaste propriÃ©tÃ© de l'Ã©vÃªchÃ© est traversÃ©e par quelques nouvelles rues. Le noyau religieux domine l'ensemble du secteur.\n\nÃ€ partir de 1873, le passage du chemin de fer Intercolonial et la construction de la gare entraÃ®nent le dÃ©veloppement du secteur sud. Nombre d'Ã©difices s'Ã©lÃ¨vent alors Ã  proximitÃ© de la voie ferrÃ©e. Le nouveau sÃ©minaire (1881) puis l'archevÃªchÃ© (1903) y sont implantÃ©s. Les rÃ©sidences des notables de la ville sont Ã©galement construites dans le secteur. L'Ã©dification de l'orphelinat des Soeurs de la CharitÃ© (1907), de l'hÃ´pital Saint-Joseph (1923) et de l'Ã©cole SacrÃ©-Coeur (1924) accentue le caractÃ¨re institutionnel du secteur. Plusieurs Ã©tablissements d'enseignement complÃ¨tent l'ensemble dans les dÃ©cennies suivantes : les Ã©difices de la SociÃ©tÃ© d'agriculture de Rimouski et les Ã©coles de marine, de commerce et de technologie. \n\nEn 1950, une conflagration rase l'orphelinat et endommage plusieurs bÃ¢timents, dont l'hÃ´pital Saint-Joseph.

En effet, il y a 4 000 ou 5 000 ans, les AmÃ©rindiens le frÃ©quentent. En 1535, le navigateur Jacques Cartier (1491-1557) lui donne le nom de mont Royal. \n\nEn 1642, Ville-Marie est fondÃ©e par un groupe dirigÃ© par Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve (1612-1676) et Jeanne Mance (1606-1673). DÃ¨s l'annÃ©e suivante, une relation Ã©troite se tisse entre la montagne et les colons. En effet, pour remercier la Providence d'avoir Ã©pargnÃ© les habitations d'une inondation, Maisonneuve fait Ã©riger une croix sur la montagne. \n\nEn 1663, les prÃªtres de Saint-Sulpice deviennent seigneurs de l'Ã®le de MontrÃ©al. Ils Ã©tablissent leur domaine au pied de la montagne, qui devient le coeur d'un espace agricole prospÃ¨re pendant prÃ¨s de deux siÃ¨cles.\n\nAu cours du XIXe siÃ¨cle, la croissance accÃ©lÃ©rÃ©e de MontrÃ©al et les mutations de l'Ã©conomie transforment l'environnement de la montagne. Certains fiefs sont lotis et des rÃ©sidences bourgeoises sont construites, alors que le phÃ©nomÃ¨ne de la villÃ©giature se dÃ©veloppe. De plus, certains Ã©tablissements s'installent sur les flancs du mont Royal. L'UniversitÃ© McGill est crÃ©Ã©e en 1837, et l'HÃ´tel-Dieu est construit entre 1858 et 1861. \n\nLe milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle voit aussi naÃ®tre une prÃ©occupation croissante pour l'hygiÃ¨ne publique. De nouveaux cimetiÃ¨res sont amÃ©nagÃ©s hors de la ville, notamment sur la montagne, dont celui de Notre-Dame-des-Neiges en 1854. Cette Ã©poque correspond aussi Ã  la construction des premiers rÃ©servoirs d'eau potable dans le sol de la montagne. \n\nÃ€ partir de 1870, la montagne est rattrapÃ©e par l'urbanisation. Pour prÃ©server ce lieu, le conseil municipal de MontrÃ©al achÃ¨te des terrains en 1872 et mandate Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), architecte paysagiste, pour amÃ©nager le parc du Mont-Royal. Les travaux s'Ã©chelonnent entre 1874 et 1877; le parc est inaugurÃ© en 1876. Il s'agit lÃ  du premier geste de protection d'un paysage patrimonial au QuÃ©bec. \n\nEntre 1880 et 1930, la vocation institutionnelle des flancs du mont Royal se consolide. De nouveaux pavillons de l'UniversitÃ© McGill sont Ã©rigÃ©s et les hÃ´pitaux Royal Victoria et Shriners sont inaugurÃ©s en 1893 et 1925. Sur le versant nord, le collÃ¨ge Jean-de-BrÃ©beuf est construit en 1928. Le mont Royal accueille aussi d'importants monuments commÃ©moratifs, dont celui de George-Ã‰tienne Cartier (1919) et la croix rappelant le geste de Maisonneuve (1924). \n\nPendant cette pÃ©riode, le mont Royal devient aussi le thÃ©Ã¢tre d'activitÃ©s rÃ©crÃ©atives et de manifestations populaires. Il est parcouru par les raquetteurs et sert aux dÃ©filÃ©s militaires, aux expositions et Ã  divers rassemblements. En 1873, le premier terrain de golf au Canada y est amÃ©nagÃ©. ConsÃ©quence de cette affluence, un funiculaire est mis en service en 1885, et un belvÃ©dÃ¨re est construit en 1906.\n\nEntre 1930 et 1980, la montagne est complÃ¨tement ceinturÃ©e par le tissu urbain. L'expansion des institutions se poursuit, notamment avec l'achÃ¨vement des bÃ¢timents originaux de l'UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al et de l'oratoire Saint-Joseph. Sur la montagne, des Ã©quipements rÃ©crÃ©atifs sont aussi Ã©rigÃ©s, dont le pavillon du Lac-aux-Castors.\n\nLes annÃ©es 1980 amÃ¨nent avec elles des projets controversÃ©s. Le mont Royal est alors convoitÃ© par des promoteurs. Certains projets sont contestÃ©s par des groupes de dÃ©fense du patrimoine, dont les Amis de la montagne, organisme crÃ©Ã© en 1982, et le Centre de la montagne fondÃ© en 1987.\n\nLe site du patrimoine du Mont-Royal est constituÃ© en 1987.

En 1870, le village de la CÃ´te-de-la-Visitation est fondÃ© et devient, en 1895, la municipalitÃ© du Village de la Petite-CÃ´te. Les propriÃ©tÃ©s appartiennent alors majoritairement Ã  des familles anglophones, comme les Crawford, les Molson et les Drummond.\n\nAu dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, la compagnie de chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Ã©rige les usines Angus dans le secteur. DÃ¨s l'annonce de la construction des usines, la compagnie Rosemount Land and Improvement Company (RLIC) achÃ¨te les terres agricoles environnantes, dont celle des Crawford situÃ©e immÃ©diatement au nord du site industriel, dans le but de les subdiviser.\n\nEn 1903, la RLIC adopte un plan de lotissement orthogonal oÃ¹ les avenues de l'axe nord-sud sont rÃ©servÃ©es aux habitations et les voies de l'axe est-ouest, aux commerces et aux institutions. L'influence des promoteurs immobiliers est Ã©norme et, en vendant des lots, ces derniers encouragent l'urbanisation du secteur. En 1905, devant l'urbanisation sans cesse grandissante du territoire et l'augmentation du nombre des habitants, le secteur devient le village de Rosemont. L'annÃ©e 1905 marque l'Ã©rection de la paroisse de Sainte-PhilomÃ¨ne de Rosemont par monseigneur Paul BruchÃ©si (1855-1939), archevÃªque de MontrÃ©al. Le nom de la paroisse est choisi en l'honneur de l'Ã©pouse de Pierre Desforges, le donateur des terrains destinÃ©s Ã  la construction d'une Ã©glise. Le village de Rosemont est annexÃ© Ã  la ville de MontrÃ©al en 1906.\n\nEntre 1910 et 1915, la population de Rosemont augmente considÃ©rablement et compte prÃ¨s de 500 familles. Par ailleurs, la rue Masson commence Ã  se commercialiser avec la construction de ses premiers bÃ¢timents Ã  fonction mixte. Une premiÃ¨re chapelle avait Ã©tÃ© Ã©rigÃ©e en 1905. Le presbytÃ¨re actuel est construit en 1914. \n\nLa chapelle devenue trop exiguÃ« pour les besoins de la paroisse, le projet de construire une Ã©glise se fait de plus en plus pressant. Cette derniÃ¨re est rÃ©alisÃ©e en deux Ã©tapes. Dans un premier temps, le soubassement est Ã©rigÃ© en 1922 et 1923 d'aprÃ¨s les plans de Joseph-Ã‰gide-CÃ©saire Daoust (1881-1946). Puis l'Ã©glise est complÃ©tÃ©e entre 1931 et 1933 par le mÃªme architecte. \n\nJoseph-Ã‰gide-CÃ©saire Daoust, originaire de MontrÃ©al, est associÃ© depuis 1904 Ã  Louis-ZÃ©phirin Gauthier (1842-1922). La firme Gauthier & Daoust rÃ©alise un grand nombre d'Ã©difices religieux et institutionnels parmi lesquels figurent l'Ã‰cole des Hautes Ã‰tudes Commerciales (1908), l'Ã©glise Saint-Viateur d'Outremont (1911) et l'Institut des Sourds-muets (1916-1921).\n\nDurant les annÃ©es 1920 et 1930, la rue Masson, alors desservie par le tramway, s'affirme comme le centre des services et du commerce. De nombreux immeubles commerciaux et de bureaux sont construits, de mÃªme que des banques, dont la Banque de MontrÃ©al (1927-1928). ConÃ§us par les architectes Harold Lawson et Harold Little, ce bÃ¢timent reflÃ¨te l'expansion dÃ©mographique et la prospÃ©ritÃ© Ã©conomique du quartier Rosemont des trente premiÃ¨res annÃ©es du XXe siÃ¨cle. En outre, de nombreux commerces s'Ã©tablissent sur la rue Masson, tels ceux des marchands ElzÃ©ar TÃ©treault (1914) et J.-Alcide Gauthier (1925), du mÃ©decin Joseph Millier (1913) et du dentiste Armand Sarrasin (1928-1929).\n\nL'essor du village de Rosemont est concentrÃ© principalement autour de l'Ã©glise, intimement liÃ©e au dÃ©veloppement de la rue Masson et du quartier Rosemont au dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle.\n\nEn 1961, l'Ã©glise prend le nom de Saint-Esprit-de-Rosemont.\n\nLe site du patrimoine de l'Ã‰glise-de-Saint-Esprit-de-Rosemont est constituÃ© en 1991.

Une chapelle est construite la mÃªme annÃ©e. En 1726, le pÃ¨re Pierre-Michel Laure (1688-1838), un missionnaire jÃ©suite, fait Ã©riger une chapelle en bois Ã  l'emplacement du premier temple dÃ©truit par le feu en 1682. Ã€ la suite de la ConquÃªte, le poste de traite est repris par les marchands de fourrures britanniques. \n\nEn 1843, William Price (1789-1867) et son associÃ© Peter McLeod (1807-1852) sont attirÃ©s par le potentiel de la riviÃ¨re de Chicoutimi. Ils acquiÃ¨rent un site entre la riviÃ¨re et le poste de traite et y Ã©rigent une scierie. Elle devient rapidement la plus importante industrie du Saguenay et attire de nombreux ouvriers. Ceux-ci s'Ã©tablissent Ã  proximitÃ© dans des maisons construites par la Compagnie pour loger ses employÃ©s. En 1895, Louis Robin, chef mesureur pour la Compagnie Price, acquiert l'une de ces maisons. Construite en 1865, elle est situÃ©e sur un promontoire rocheux, prÃ¨s de la riviÃ¨re Chicoutimi.\n\nLa paroisse du SacrÃ©-Coeur est Ã©rigÃ©e en 1903. Elle est confiÃ©e aux Eudistes, une congrÃ©gation religieuse fondÃ©e en France en 1643 et en exil au QuÃ©bec pour fuir l'anticlÃ©ricalisme. Ces derniers obtiennent Ã©galement la charge de la prÃ©fecture apostolique du Golfe du Saint-Laurent. DÃ¨s son arrivÃ©e, la congrÃ©gation reÃ§oit de la Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi, fondÃ©e en 1896, un terrain pour la construction d'une Ã©glise et d'un presbytÃ¨re. Toutefois, le site prÃ©sente un sol instable. Les Eudistes optent alors pour un terrain situÃ© sur le Cran Chaud, dont une partie appartient Ã  la Compagnie de Pulpe. Celle-ci cÃ¨de Ã  la congrÃ©gation ses droits de propriÃ©tÃ© en Ã©change du terrain oÃ¹ est Ã©rigÃ©e la chapelle du SacrÃ©-Coeur (1892 et 1893). Les travaux de construction de l'Ã©glise du SacrÃ©-Coeur commencent en 1903 d'aprÃ¨s les plans de l'architecte RenÃ©-Pamphile Lemay (1870-1915). Pour des motifs financiers, l'Ã©rection d'un presbytÃ¨re est remise Ã  plus tard. Les Eudistes utilisent comme maison curiale un petit hÃ´tel acquis d'EugÃ¨ne Belley en 1904. Le bÃ¢timent est situÃ© au coin des rues TachÃ© et BossÃ©, au pied de la cÃ´te oÃ¹ est Ã©levÃ©e l'Ã©glise. Celle-ci est achevÃ©e et bÃ©nie en 1905.\n\nEn 1909, une cuisine d'Ã©tÃ© est annexÃ©e Ã  l'arriÃ¨re de la maison Robin et une galerie est amÃ©nagÃ©e sur deux cÃ´tÃ©s. \n\nEn 1915, une place est amÃ©nagÃ©e devant l'Ã©glise, et un monument du SacrÃ©-Coeur est Ã©rigÃ©. En 1918 et 1919, le presbytÃ¨re est construit aux cÃ´tÃ©s de l'Ã©glise d'aprÃ¨s les plans de l'architecte Alfred Lamontagne (1883-1967). Ce dernier dessine Ã©galement les plans de la sacristie Ã©levÃ©e en 1919 et 1920. Au cours des annÃ©es suivantes, des dÃ©marches sont entreprises pour le remplacement de la structure de l'Ã©glise afin de la mettre Ã  l'Ã©preuve du feu ainsi que pour l'achÃ¨vement du dÃ©cor intÃ©rieur. Les travaux sont rÃ©alisÃ©s en 1928 et 1929 d'aprÃ¨s les plans de Lamontagne.

Ses rives et ses terrasses auraient fait l'objet d'occupations sporadiques par les groupes amÃ©rindiens environ 4000 ans avant aujourd'hui. Ils y auraient Ã©tabli des campements temporaires. DÃ¨s les dÃ©buts de la Nouvelle-France, le site est frÃ©quentÃ© par les explorateurs et les missionnaires franÃ§ais de passage. La riviÃ¨re porterait le nom du premier EuropÃ©en qui aurait apparemment naviguÃ© dans ses eaux en 1610, le sieur des Prairies, un navigateur de Saint-Malo et compagnon de Champlain. \n\nEn 1663, les Sulpiciens deviennent seigneurs de l'Ã®le de MontrÃ©al. Ils concÃ¨dent d'abord deux fiefs situÃ©s Ã  l'est de l'actuel village de RiviÃ¨res-des-Prairies, puis accordent des terres aux colons Ã  partir de 1671. Sur toute l'Ã®le, les lots concÃ©dÃ©s prennent essentiellement la forme de longues bandes Ã©troites ayant front sur la riviÃ¨re ou sur le fleuve. La CÃ´te-de-la-RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies, l'actuel boulevard Gouin Est, est alors la seule voie terrestre.\n\nEn 1687, la paroisse de Saint-Joseph de RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies est fondÃ©e. Une Ã©glise en bois est alors Ã©levÃ©e Ã  l'emplacement du lieu de culte actuel. Celle-ci est remplacÃ©e par une Ã©glise en pierre entre 1708 et 1711. Un presbytÃ¨re est Ã©galement Ã©rigÃ©. Dans les annÃ©es 1730, un noyau villageois se dessine Ã  proximitÃ©. \n\nAu dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle, le village prend de l'expansion et se dÃ©veloppe le long du boulevard Gouin, l'artÃ¨re principale. En 1831, le village ne compte qu'une dizaine de maisons de plus alors qu'une Ã©cole (aujourd'hui disparue) est bÃ¢tie Ã  l'est de l'Ã©glise. En 1845, la paroisse est constituÃ©e en municipalitÃ©. De 1875 Ã  1879, l'Ã©glise et le presbytÃ¨re sont reconstruits suivant les plans de Victor Bourgeau (1809-1888). Le rÃ©putÃ© architecte, fidÃ¨le Ã  sa pratique dans le diocÃ¨se de MontrÃ©al, conÃ§oit une Ã©glise sobre, d'inspiration nÃ©ogothique. \n\nAu dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1910, la municipalitÃ© connaÃ®t une certaine densification en raison de sa situation le long d'un cours d'eau, un environnement propice Ã  la villÃ©giature.

La seigneurie de Neuville, aussi connue sous les noms de Dombourg et de Pointe-aux-Trembles, est concÃ©dÃ©e en 1653. Le peuplement de la rÃ©gion ne commence toutefois vÃ©ritablement qu'au XVIIIe siÃ¨cle. DÃ¨s 1793, les habitants de l'actuel territoire de Pont-Rouge adressent des requÃªtes Ã  l'Ã©vÃªque de QuÃ©bec pour la construction d'une chapelle, afin de ne plus avoir Ã  parcourir les grandes distances les sÃ©parant des Ã©glises de Neuville et de Cap-SantÃ© auxquelles ils sont rattachÃ©s. Les demandes se rÃ©pÃ¨tent jusqu'au milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle, soutenues par une population sans cesse croissante. La paroisse Sainte-Jeanne est finalement Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement en avril 1867.\n\nEn 1868, les travaux de construction de l'Ã©glise et du presbytÃ¨re sont entrepris, sur un terrain donnÃ© Ã  la fabrique par Narcisse Beaudry et Basile Mottard. Le lieu de culte est rÃ©alisÃ© selon les plans de Jean-Baptiste Derome (1837-1910). Il s'agit du seul Ã©difice religieux qu'il conÃ§oit dans la rÃ©gion. La pierre nÃ©cessaire est tirÃ©e des berges de la riviÃ¨re Jacques-Cartier. En 1869, le gros oeuvre de l'Ã©glise est achevÃ©. La construction de la maison curiale se termine l'annÃ©e suivante.\n\nC'est Ã  la mÃªme Ã©poque qu'est amÃ©nagÃ© le cimetiÃ¨re paroissial. Les premiÃ¨res sÃ©pultures y sont faites en octobre 1869. De 1870 Ã  1901, un certain nombre de paroissiens sont Ã©galement inhumÃ©s dans le caveau de l'Ã©glise. Il s'agit d'un privilÃ¨ge spÃ©cial, qui coÃ»te beaucoup plus cher.\n\nLa population connaÃ®t une importante croissance dÃ©mographique, accentuÃ©e aprÃ¨s l'Ã©tablissement du chemin de fer du Canadien Pacifique en 1874. De nouvelles industries s'implantent et attirent de nouveaux habitants. En 1878, une tribune doit Ãªtre construite dans le lieu de culte. En 1880 et 1881, le dÃ©cor intÃ©rieur est rÃ©alisÃ© selon les plans de l'architecte David Ouellet (1844-1915).\n\nEn 1893, des travaux importants de rÃ©fection du toit et de la faÃ§ade sont effectuÃ©s. Une couverture de tÃ´le galvanisÃ©e est posÃ©e et le clocher ainsi que les clochetons sont construits. Les travaux sont rÃ©alisÃ©s par Joseph BussiÃ¨res (nÃ© vers 1865).\n\nAu dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, le lieu de culte s'avÃ¨re Ã  nouveau trop exigu. L'architecte PhilÃ©as Myrand conÃ§oit les plans de l'agrandissement en 1907. Le choeur de mÃªme que la sacristie sont dÃ©molis et font place au transept actuel. Un nouveau choeur ceinturÃ© d'une tribune est construit ainsi qu'une sacristie. L'Ã©glise passe alors de 176 Ã  300 bancs. Les travaux sont terminÃ©s en 1908. L'annÃ©e suivante, l'Ã©glise accueille deux statues rÃ©alisÃ©es par Louis Jobin (1845-1928), reprÃ©sentant sainte Jeanne-FranÃ§oise de Chantal et saint Tharcisius.\n\nLa premiÃ¨re maison curiale se dÃ©tÃ©riorant rapidement, le presbytÃ¨re actuel est construit en 1917 par l'entrepreneur ElzÃ©ar MÃ©tivier et fils. De nouveaux travaux sont aussi effectuÃ©s Ã  l'intÃ©rieur du lieu de culte, puisqu'on amÃ©nage les tribunes du transept en 1919. Les porches en appentis du transept sont bÃ¢tis en 1940 selon les plans de l'architecte RenÃ© Blanchet (1908-1991).\n\nDans la premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© du XXe siÃ¨cle, plusieurs activitÃ©s culturelles se tiennent dans une salle du collÃ¨ge Saint-Charles. Ce lieu se rÃ©vÃ¨le rapidement trop exigu. Vers le milieu siÃ¨cle, l'ArchevÃªchÃ© demande que chaque fabrique prenne en charge l'organisation des loisirs.

La seigneurie Lepage-Thivierge, ou de l'Anse-aux-Coques, est attribuÃ©e Ã  Louis Lepage (1636-1710) et Gabriel Thivierge (vers 1655-1726). Elle inclut la partie est de Sainte-Luce. La seigneurie Lessard, qui comprend la partie ouest de Sainte-Luce, est octroyÃ©e Ã  Pierre Lessard (1658-1737) et Barbe Fortin (1654-1737), son Ã©pouse. \n\nLa paroisse de Sainte-Luce est Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement le 28 aoÃ»t 1829. Elle est nommÃ©e en l'honneur de Luce-Gertrude Drapeau (1794-1880), veuve de Thomas Casault, l'une des coseigneuresses Drapeau. La seigneurie connaÃ®t alors une pÃ©riode de prospÃ©ritÃ©. Les paroissiens envoient dÃ¨s l'annÃ©e suivante une requÃªte Ã  l'archevÃªque de QuÃ©bec, Bernard-Claude Panet (1753-1833), pour la construction d'une Ã©glise. Son successeur, Joseph Signay (1778-1850), donne son autorisation le 7 juin 1836, Ã  la suite d'une nouvelle pÃ©tition. \n\nPour dessiner les plans de l'Ã©glise, les paroissiens, Ã  la suggestion de Mgr Signay, font appel Ã  l'architecte de QuÃ©bec Thomas BaillairgÃ© (1791-1859). L'Ã©glise est construite de 1838 Ã  1840. Figurant parmi les principaux reprÃ©sentants au QuÃ©bec du courant nÃ©oclassique, BaillairgÃ© marque fortement l'architecture religieuse de l'est du QuÃ©bec. Il est en relation avec l'abbÃ© JÃ©rÃ´me Demers (1774-1853), avec qui il oeuvre en Ã©troite collaboration. Vicaire gÃ©nÃ©ral du diocÃ¨se de QuÃ©bec, professeur d'architecture au SÃ©minaire de QuÃ©bec et auteur du Â« PrÃ©cis d'architecture Â», Demers est chargÃ© d'approuver les plans des nouvelles Ã©glises. Ã€ Sainte-Luce, les paroissiens demandent Ã  BaillairgÃ© de s'inspirer des dimensions de la nef de l'Ã©glise de Saint-Germain Ã  Rimouski. Ils veulent aussi la doter d'un choeur plus Ã©troit, comme celui de l'Ã©glise de Saint-AndrÃ© Ã  Kamouraska. AprÃ¨s avoir choisi une abside en hÃ©micycle, ils optent finalement pour un chevet plat, considÃ©rÃ© comme plus commode.\n\nPendant ce temps, la paroisse est Ã©rigÃ©e en municipalitÃ© sous le nom de Lessard en 1835. Dix ans plus tard, elle est renommÃ©e Sainte-Luce-de-Lessard.\n\nLe deuxiÃ¨me presbytÃ¨re est converti afin d'accueillir les nombreux touristes. En effet, le village, dÃ©signÃ© populairement sous le nom de Sainte-Luce-sur-Mer, devient dans la seconde moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle un lieu de villÃ©giature. Encore aujourd'hui, sa plage de sable, considÃ©rÃ©e comme l'une des plus belles de la rÃ©gion, attire les touristes et les villÃ©giateurs. Le quai qui s'avance vers l'est, Ã  l'extrÃ©mitÃ© de l'anse aux Coques, sert notamment Ã  de multiples excursions effectuÃ©es sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent.\n\nLe presbytÃ¨re actuel est construit en 1914 pour remplacer le prÃ©cÃ©dent. Son revÃªtement est constituÃ© de briques probablement importÃ©es d'Ã‰cosse.\n\nL'autre bÃ¢timent qui s'Ã©lÃ¨ve sur le site a servi de maison au bedeau. La maison est aujourd'hui convertie en restaurant, le Bistro Bar Le Nipigon, oÃ¹ sont servies des spÃ©cialitÃ©s rÃ©gionales.\n\nL'Ã©glise est modifiÃ©e de maniÃ¨re importante en 1914. David Ouellet et Pierre LÃ©vesque (1880-1955), architectes associÃ©s de QuÃ©bec, conÃ§oivent une nouvelle faÃ§ade. L'Ã©glise est ainsi allongÃ©e de prÃ¨s de 10 mÃ¨tres.

Le peuplement de ce territoire remonte Ã  l'Ã©poque du RÃ©gime franÃ§ais. La seigneurie de Bonaventure est concÃ©dÃ©e en 1697. Ã€ compter de 1756, plusieurs Acadiens, victimes du Grand DÃ©rangement, s'installent Ã  l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re CascapÃ©dia. AprÃ¨s la ConquÃªte, ils sont suivis par des Ã‰cossais et des Irlandais, puis par des Loyalistes qui s'Ã©tablissent dans le secteur en 1784.\n\nÃ€ la fin du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle, la population de New Richmond est surtout anglophone et d'origine Ã©cossaise. Au XIXe siÃ¨cle, la famille Ã©cossaise Carswell s'Ã©tablit sur la pointe Duthie. Aux environs de 1820, les frÃ¨res Georges et John Duthie exploitent des moulins Ã  scie ainsi qu'un chantier naval Ã  proximitÃ© de leurs propriÃ©tÃ©s Ã©galement situÃ©es sur le site. Vers la moitiÃ© du XIXe siÃ¨cle, l'Ã‰cossais William Cuthbert y exploite un chantier naval, nommÃ© Shipyard Point. Celui-ci constitue l'un des plus importants chantiers en GaspÃ©sie. L'agriculture et, dans une moindre mesure, la pÃªche Ã  la morue reprÃ©sentent d'autres moyens de subsistance des habitants. Ã€ partir de 1888, la pointe Duthie est Ã©galement connue sous le nom de Pointe-des-Gouverneurs; en effet, le gouverneur gÃ©nÃ©ral du Canada de l'Ã©poque, Frederic Arthur Stanley (1841-1908), y fait construire une maison pour ses sÃ©jours de pÃªche. \n\nAu cours du XIXe siÃ¨cle, de plus en plus de Canadiens franÃ§ais s'installent Ã  New Richmond et cohabitent avec les rÃ©sidents d'origine britannique qui comptent toujours pour 60 pour cent de la population de la localitÃ© en 1871.\n\nAu dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, Oswald Robert Willett construit sa rÃ©sidence sur la pointe Duthie qui accueille, depuis plusieurs gÃ©nÃ©rations, des membres de sa famille. Ã€ la mÃªme Ã©poque, Henry Carswell lÃ¨gue une parcelle de son lot afin d'y Ã©lever un phare qui est opÃ©rationnel de 1903 Ã  1914. En 1910, John Willett fait Ã©galement construire sa rÃ©sidence sur la pointe. Vers le milieu du XXe siÃ¨cle, le secteur de New Richmond Ouest, qui inclut la pointe Duthie, demeure majoritairement anglophone.\n\nDans les annÃ©es 1980, la population d'origine britannique ne compte plus que pour 13,9 pour cent de la population de New Richmond. En 1984, des descendants des premiers colons anglophones se regroupent Ã  la pointe Duthie pour commÃ©morer l'arrivÃ©e des Loyalistes deux cents ans plus tÃ´t. Ce regroupement mÃ¨ne Ã  la crÃ©ation du Centre d'hÃ©ritage britannique de la GaspÃ©sie qui commÃ©more l'apport de tous les groupes d'origine britannique, qu'ils soient anglais, gallois, irlandais, Ã©cossais ou jersiais, au dÃ©veloppement de l'endroit.

Leur premiÃ¨re requÃªte formulÃ©e en 1904 est refusÃ©e. Les autoritÃ©s religieuses acceptent l'implantation d'une mission religieuse Ã  Saint-Joseph-de-Kamouraska en 1917. Pour Ã©tablir la paroisse, le territoire doit Ãªtre rÃ©amÃ©nagÃ©. Les rangs IX, V et VI sont donc dÃ©tachÃ©s de Saint-AndrÃ©. La dÃ©limitation de la nouvelle paroisse soulÃ¨ve le mÃ©contentement de certaines personnes de Sainte-HÃ©lÃ¨ne et de Saint-Alexandre. La paroisse ainsi crÃ©Ã©e se compose dÃ¨s lors de 70 familles. Ses activitÃ©s commencent en 1917, et l'abbÃ© Jules Gervais cÃ©lÃ¨bre la premiÃ¨re messe dans une chapelle amÃ©nagÃ©e dans une maison privÃ©e. \n\nLa construction de l'Ã©glise a lieu deux ans plus tard selon les plans de l'architecte Joseph-SimÃ©on Bergeron (1878-1955).

Ã€ l'origine, tous les citoyens anglophones partagent le mÃªme lieu de culte, soit l'Ã©glise anglicane Saint-James-the-Apostle, construite en 1912. Au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1920, la communautÃ© presbytÃ©rienne de KÃ©nogami, regroupant principalement des Ã‰cossais, se rÃ©unit dans un centre communautaire ainsi que dans le hall d'une Ã©cole protestante. \n\nEn 1925, l'Ã‰glise unie du Canada est fondÃ©e. Elle rassemble une partie des presbytÃ©riens et tous les mÃ©thodistes et les congrÃ©gationalistes du pays. AprÃ¨s leur adhÃ©sion Ã  cette Ã‰glise, les presbytÃ©riens de KÃ©nogami se dotent d'un nouveau temple mieux adaptÃ© Ã  leurs besoins. La compagnie Price Brothers leur vend une ancienne Ã©cole catholique situÃ©e prÃ¨s de la riviÃ¨re Saguenay, ainsi qu'un terrain sur la rue King George.

En 1869, une premiÃ¨re chapelle y est construite. Elle est dÃ©vastÃ©e lors du grand feu de 1870 qui ravage une bonne partie de la rÃ©gion du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Jusqu'Ã  la construction d'une nouvelle chapelle en 1884, c'est un presbytÃ¨re implantÃ© en 1872 qui est utilisÃ© comme lieu de rassemblement. En 1889, la mission Caskouia du Lac-KÃ©nogami devient officiellement la paroisse Saint-Cyriac. \n\nEntre 1902 et 1905, l'actuelle chapelle Saint-Cyriac, Ã©galement connue sous le nom de chapelle du Lac-KÃ©nogami, est Ã©levÃ©e sur un nouvel emplacement selon les plans de l'architecte HermÃ©nÃ©gilde Morin. La construction de ce lieu de culte plus spacieux s'avÃ¨re essentielle en raison de l'augmentation importante de la population de la paroisse vers la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Elle prÃ©sente en outre de grandes similaritÃ©s sur le plan formel avec les autres Ã©glises conÃ§ues par HermÃ©nÃ©gilde Morin dans la rÃ©gion. L'Ã©glise de Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin du Lac-Bouchette (1898) et l'Ã©glise de Saint-FranÃ§ois-de-Sales de la municipalitÃ© du mÃªme nom (1903-1904) sont l'oeuvre de Morin. \n\nEn 1921, la paroisse Saint-Cyriac est Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement par un dÃ©cret de Mgr Michel-Thomas Labrecque (1849-1932). En 1924, les barrages Portage-des-Roches et Pibrac et plusieurs digues sont construits pour satisfaire les besoins grandissants des scieries de JonquiÃ¨re et de Chicoutimi. Ã€ la suite de ces travaux, le niveau d'eau du lac KÃ©nogami augmente et menace d'inonder le village. Le chemin KÃ©nogami est dÃ©placÃ©, plusieurs terrains sont expropriÃ©s et tous les bÃ¢timents qui se trouvent dans la zone inondable sont dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ©s, dont le presbytÃ¨re de Saint-Cyriac qui est transfÃ©rÃ© Ã  Larouche, une municipalitÃ© voisine. Le conseil municipal de Lac-KÃ©nogami et la fabrique abandonnent leurs fonctions. En 1925, Saint-Cyriac devient une desserte de la paroisse Saint-Dominique. La chapelle est pour sa part vendue Ã  l'encan; un groupe de citoyens s'en porte acquÃ©reur et la conserve sur place. Cependant, elle ne sert plus comme lieu de culte. \n\nÃ€ partir de 1944, la chapelle est de nouveau ouverte au culte. En 1948, elle est concÃ©dÃ©e gratuitement Ã  la Corporation Ã©piscopale catholique romaine de Chicoutimi par le groupe de citoyens propriÃ©taires. \n\nEn 1985, le conseil municipal de Lac-KÃ©nogami reprend ses fonctions.

Natif de Saint-Raymond-de-Portneuf, ce dernier est considÃ©rÃ© comme l'un des statuaires quÃ©bÃ©cois les plus prolifiques du tournant du XXe siÃ¨cle.

Ceux-ci sont rapidement dotÃ©s d'infrastructures municipales, scolaires et religieuses.\n\nLa paroisse Saint-Luc de Chicoutimi est crÃ©Ã©e en 1950 par une division de la paroisse Sainte-Anne. Une chapelle pouvant recevoir 175 paroissiens est temporairement amÃ©nagÃ©e dans un ancien atelier de Brassard et FrÃ¨res, situÃ© Ã  l'angle des rues Saint-Ã‰phrem et Roussel. Un premier presbytÃ¨re est construit sur la rue Saint-Ã‰phrem, Ã  proximitÃ© du lieu de culte. La mÃªme annÃ©e, l'entrepreneur Armand Dion, de QuÃ©bec, Ã©difie un centre social pour les habitants du quartier; ce bÃ¢timent en bÃ©ton armÃ© sert de lieu de culte jusqu'Ã  l'Ã©rection de la nouvelle Ã©glise. \n\nAu dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1960, le diocÃ¨se de Chicoutimi souhaite offrir des Ã©glises au goÃ»t du jour Ã  ses nouvelles paroisses. Ainsi, des expÃ©riences architecturales novatrices font leur apparition. En 1963, le ComitÃ© d'art diocÃ©sain reÃ§oit les plans d'une Ã©glise en bÃ©ton de 43,9 mÃ¨tres de longueur sur 23,9 de largeur et de 18,3 mÃ¨tres de hauteur. La nef de ce nouveau temple peut recevoir une assistance de 900 fidÃ¨les. Un presbytÃ¨re d'un Ã©tage relie l'Ã©glise au niveau du choeur. Ce projet retenu pour la paroisse Saint-Luc est prÃ©sentÃ© par l'architecte Jacques Coutu (nÃ© en 1927). Originaire de Chicoutimi, ce dernier fait ses Ã©tudes Ã  l'Ã‰cole des beaux-arts de MontrÃ©al. Un sÃ©jour en Europe, notamment en SuÃ¨de et au Danemark, le met en contact avec une architecture moderne adaptÃ©e au contexte nordique. Il accomplit son stage dans le bureau des architectes LÃ©once DesgagnÃ© (1908-1979) et Paul Boileau (nÃ© en 1906). Coutu ouvre ensuite son propre bureau en 1957. En moins d'une dÃ©cennie, il dresse les plans de cinq Ã©glises de la rÃ©gion du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, dont trois dans la ville de Chicoutimi. Il conÃ§oit en outre des Ã©difices rÃ©sidentiels, commerciaux, industriels et institutionnels. Il acquiert Ã©galement une grande expertise en architecture scolaire. AssociÃ© Ã  l'architecte Yves Bergeron durant les douze derniÃ¨res annÃ©es de sa pratique, Jacques Coutu prend sa retraite en 1991.\n\nL'Ã©glise Saint-Luc et le presbytÃ¨re sont construits par l'entrepreneur LÃ©o Gravel de Chicoutimi. CommencÃ©s en 1963, les travaux se terminent l'annÃ©e suivante. DÃ¨s la conception, le sous-sol de l'Ã©glise est pensÃ© pour servir de salle communautaire. Par ailleurs, le sous-sol du presbytÃ¨re permet d'offrir des locaux Ã  des organismes parareligieux. En 1989, l'Ã©glise est endommagÃ©e par un lÃ©ger incendie qui prend naissance dans la cuisine du sous-sol. Les dommages sont limitÃ©s, et l'intÃ©rieur de l'Ã©glise est alors repeint.

L'Ã©rection de l'Ã©glise commence en 1772 et se termine en 1773. Un premier presbytÃ¨re s'Ã©lÃ¨ve Ã  proximitÃ© en 1778. Il est remplacÃ© par un autre bÃ¢timent environ soixante ans plus tard. L'Ã©glise est agrandie Ã  deux reprises, en 1824 et 1854. En 1880, elle est remplacÃ©e par un lieu de culte plus grand. Celui-ci, conÃ§u par l'architecte David Ouellet (1844-1915) et Ã©rigÃ© par l'entrepreneur Cyrias Ouellet, est bÃ©ni le 1er dÃ©cembre 1881. Le 14 dÃ©cembre 1890, un incendie le dÃ©truit, mais n'endommage pas les murs de pierre. Ceux-ci sont conservÃ©s et l'Ã©glise est reconstruite selon les mÃªmes plans et devis par l'entrepreneur Joseph Gosselin. Celle-ci est consacrÃ©e le 25 octobre 1891; sa finition intÃ©rieure est complÃ©tÃ©e en 1893.\n\nAu dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle, l'emplacement du presbytÃ¨re, Ã©loignÃ© de la sacristie, pose un problÃ¨me. En 1920, le curÃ© Louis-AdÃ©lard Gagnon demande l'autorisation de construire une nouvelle maison curiale au sud-est de la sacristie. Pour obtenir les terrains nÃ©cessaires, la fabrique cÃ¨de Ã  la municipalitÃ© le vieux presbytÃ¨re. Les travaux, confiÃ©s Ã  l'entrepreneur F.-X. Lambert, commencent en mai 1920 et se terminent en avril 1921. C'est Ã  cette Ã©poque que la grange Ã  dÃ®me est implantÃ©e Ã  l'arriÃ¨re de la maison curiale. \n\nLe noyau institutionnel de Cap-Saint-Ignace est constituÃ© site du patrimoine en 2007.

En 1923, le prospecteur Robert C. Clark, accompagnÃ© du guide algonquin Gabriel Commandant (1891-1967), dÃ©couvre une veine d'or dans le canton de Bourlamaque et jalonne une propriÃ©tÃ© de 600 acres. En 1924, le New-Yorkais William A. Read acquiert la propriÃ©tÃ© miniÃ¨re. DiffÃ©rentes veines aurifÃ¨res sont mises au jour. En 1928, Read forme avec Hector Authier (1881-1971), homme d'affaires et dÃ©putÃ© d'Abitibi depuis 1923, la Read-Authier Mines Limited, qui entreprend un programme de forage en 1929. La crise Ã©conomique entraÃ®ne la suspension des travaux l'annÃ©e suivante.\n\nEn 1932, la Read-Authier Mines, Ã  la recherche de capitaux, s'associe Ã  la Teck-Hughes Gold Mines Limited pour constituer la Lamaque Gold Mines Limited. Les nouveaux forages d'exploration sont concluants et la mise en valeur du gisement s'amorce. L'amÃ©nagement du site dÃ©bute en 1934, alors que la valeur du mÃ©tal jaune bondit et que le dÃ©veloppement minier s'accÃ©lÃ¨re dans la vallÃ©e de l'Or (secteur des sources de la riviÃ¨re Harricana), qui voit quinze mines s'ouvrir en quelques annÃ©es. Ã€ la mine Lamaque sont notamment Ã©rigÃ©s, de 1934 Ã  1938, la sÃ©cherie, les chevalements des puits 6 et 7, la salle du treuil, la rÃ©serve Ã  minerai, le laboratoire d'analyse, le bureau principal, l'usine de traitement et le chÃ¢teau d'eau. La compagnie crÃ©e, de plus, la premiÃ¨re municipalitÃ© de La VallÃ©e-de-l'Or.

En 1941, elle emploie 700 travailleurs.\n\nDurant la DeuxiÃ¨me Guerre mondiale (1939-1945), la pÃ©nurie de main-d'oeuvre se fait sentir et la production diminue. La reprise s'amorce en 1947, notamment grÃ¢ce Ã  l'arrivÃ©e de travailleurs immigrants. La stagnation du prix de l'or et la hausse des coÃ»ts de production forcent toutefois la fermeture de plusieurs mines de la rÃ©gion. La Lamaque survit grÃ¢ce Ã  la richesse de ses gisements et Ã  l'aide financiÃ¨re accordÃ©e par le gouvernement fÃ©dÃ©ral Ã  partir de 1948.\n\nÃ€ compter de la dÃ©cennie 1970, la question de la fermeture de la mine Lamaque se pose rÃ©guliÃ¨rement. La recherche de nouveau minerai cesse presque complÃ¨tement, rÃ©duisant drastiquement les rÃ©serves. La hausse phÃ©nomÃ©nale du prix de l'or permet nÃ©anmoins de maintenir certaines activitÃ©s comme le traitement du minerai, provenant en partie d'autres mines de la rÃ©gion.\n\nEn 1979, le village minier de Bourlamaque est classÃ©. Les diverses installations de la mine, encore en exploitation, sont exclues du pÃ©rimÃ¨tre protÃ©gÃ©.\n\nEn 1985, l'entreprise annonce la fin des activitÃ©s de traitement du minerai. Quatre ans plus tard, la fermeture complÃ¨te est officielle. En 1990, les galeries sont inondÃ©es. Plusieurs bÃ¢timents sont dÃ©mantelÃ©s en 1993, dont l'usine de traitement et le chÃ¢teau d'eau. Le milieu se mobilise alors pour protÃ©ger ce qui subsiste. La Ville de Val-d'Or acquiert les bÃ¢timents et les Ã©quipements et les cÃ¨de Ã  la Corporation du Village minier de Bourlamaque, qui entreprend l'amÃ©nagement de la CitÃ© de l'Or, un vaste lieu d'interprÃ©tation sur le thÃ¨me des mines aurifÃ¨res.\n\nLe 3 mars 1995, pendant des travaux de soudage, un incendie Ã©clate et dÃ©truit le parement du chevalement du puits 6.

Durant la seconde moitiÃ© du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle, le peuplement s'effectue lentement, en bordure du chemin du Roy, qui longe le fleuve Saint-Laurent. Une premiÃ¨re chapelle y est Ã©rigÃ©e en 1791 et 1792. En 1799, elle est reconstruite en bordure du nouveau chemin du Roy. Un autre lieu de culte en bois la remplace en 1812.

Les travaux dÃ©butent en 1855 et l'Ã©glise est ouverte l'annÃ©e suivante. Le clocher est construit de 1869 Ã  1870 par Charles Bernier, Georges Pelletier et TimothÃ©e Lebel. Les travaux de finition de l'Ã©glise sont retardÃ©s Ã  cause des problÃ¨mes de financement liÃ©s aux dimensions imposantes du lieu de culte.

NapolÃ©on Bourassa (1827-1916), architecte et artiste montrÃ©alais, trace les plans du maÃ®tre autel. \n\nDu milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle jusqu'en 1910, le dÃ©veloppement urbain de Fraserville (renommÃ©e RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup en 1919) s'accÃ©lÃ¨re. De nombreuses institutions s'implantent Ã  proximitÃ© de l'Ã©glise et font de la localitÃ© la mÃ©tropole du Bas-Saint-Laurent. Les Soeurs du Bon-Pasteur font Ã©riger leur premier couvent en 1869.

Ouellet conÃ§oit Ã©galement les plans de cet Ã©difice. Le curÃ© PhilÃ©as Roy, nommÃ© dans la paroisse au printemps 1908, fait modifier les plans.

L'Ã©tablissement d'une population permanente en ces lieux peu propices Ã  l'agriculture se fait toutefois trÃ¨s lentement. Au cours des annÃ©es 1850, la construction d'un quai permettant l'accostage des navires Ã  vapeur fait de l'endroit un lieu de transit pour les touristes qui sÃ©journent pendant l'Ã©tÃ© dans les localitÃ©s environnantes, notamment Ã  Cacouna. Ã€ la fin des annÃ©es 1880, la Pointe est intÃ©grÃ©e dans le rÃ©seau ferroviaire afin de permettre le transport des marchandises entre le train et le bateau. C'est aussi Ã  cette Ã©poque que l'endroit se transforme graduellement Ã  son tour en lieu de villÃ©giature. Le territoire, appartenant Ã  un seul propriÃ©taire, est divisÃ© en petits lots rectangulaires que les acheteurs acquiÃ¨rent souvent en bloc. \n\nNarcisse-Georges Pelletier, homme d'affaires et entrepreneur de Fraserville, se porte acquÃ©reur de nombreux terrains sur lesquels il fait Ã©riger deux hÃ´tels et une vingtaine de rÃ©sidences de villÃ©giature qu'il vend ou loue aux estivants. L'une des villas construite en 1891 deviendra un quart de siÃ¨cle plus tard le presbytÃ¨re de Sainte-Anne-des-Ondes.\n\nLe dÃ©veloppement s'accÃ©lÃ¨re au cours de la derniÃ¨re dÃ©cennie du XIXe siÃ¨cle. En 1895, Pelletier s'associe avec Mary Hayward (dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©e en 1909) afin de bÃ¢tir une chapelle, espÃ©rant ainsi stimuler la vente de terrains et la construction de nouvelles villas. Hayward donne le terrain et Pelletier effectue les travaux. Les deux parties s'entendent pour partager les divers revenus de la chapelle, dont le loyer des bancs et les quÃªtes. La premiÃ¨re messe est cÃ©lÃ©brÃ©e au dÃ©but de la saison estivale de 1896. Des difficultÃ©s financiÃ¨res obligent Pelletier Ã  cÃ©der sa part, au tournant du XXe siÃ¨cle. Son frÃ¨re, l'abbÃ© Dominique Pelletier, supÃ©rieur du collÃ¨ge de Sainte-Anne-de-la-PocatiÃ¨re de 1896 Ã  1902, en fait l'acquisition. \n\nEn 1916, lors d'une assemblÃ©e des touristes catholiques de la Pointe, il est dÃ©cidÃ© que la chapelle deviendra la propriÃ©tÃ© des estivants. Ils acquiÃ¨rent Ã©galement une villa construite Ã  proximitÃ© pour la transformer en presbytÃ¨re oÃ¹ seront logÃ©s les desservants, venant principalement du collÃ¨ge de Sainte-Anne-de-La-PocatiÃ¨re. L'ensemble est gÃ©rÃ© par la corporation archiÃ©piscopale de QuÃ©bec et est indÃ©pendant de la Loi sur les fabriques.\n\nAprÃ¨s la Seconde Guerre mondiale, la population frÃ©quentant la Pointe se modifie lentement. Alors qu'au tournant du XXe siÃ¨cle, les estivants appartenaient surtout Ã  la bourgeoisie, les touristes sont dÃ©sormais majoritairement issus de la classe moyenne et se font construire de petits chalets. Au cours des annÃ©es 1960, la population commence Ã  s'installer de faÃ§on permanente et le secteur devient peu Ã  peu un quartier rÃ©sidentiel de RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup.

Ce dernier la revend la mÃªme annÃ©e Ã  Alexander Fraser (1763-1837). Fraser dÃ©veloppe la seigneurie en concÃ©dant de nombreux lots ainsi qu'en construisant des moulins. AprÃ¨s la guerre de 1812, une communautÃ© anglophone de foi anglicane, composÃ©e d'immigrants d'origine britannique et de vÃ©tÃ©rans, s'installe Ã  RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup. Malcolm Fraser (1817-1842) hÃ©rite de la seigneurie en 1837.

La rÃ©gion est explorÃ©e en 1534 par Jacques Cartier (1491-1557) qui nomme l'endroit Â« conche Saint-Martin Â». Ã€ partir du XVIIe siÃ¨cle, ce lieu est dÃ©signÃ© sous le nom de Port-Daniel, en l'honneur du capitaine de navire Charles Daniel (dÃ©cÃ©dÃ© en 1661). La seigneurie est concÃ©dÃ©e en 1696, mais demeure inexploitÃ©e jusqu'au milieu du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle. Un premier rÃ©sidant s'installe vraisemblablement Ã  Port-Daniel en 1752. Le peuplement se poursuit au dÃ©but du XIXe siÃ¨cle avec, entre autres, l'arrivÃ©e d'Ã‰cossais et de Jersiais. En 1825, la population est de 825 habitants.\n\nLa pÃªche est le principal moteur Ã©conomique de la rÃ©gion. Les premiers bÃ¢timents Ã©rigÃ©s sur le banc de Port-Daniel sont sans doute liÃ©s aux activitÃ©s maritimes. Des habitations sont Ã©galement construites sur le site. La plus ancienne rÃ©sidence subsistant dans le secteur, la maison Legrand, est vraisemblablement Ã©rigÃ©e dans le dernier quart du XIXe siÃ¨cle. En 1899, Alfred Dumaresq Legrand (1845-1946) transforme sa demeure de style Second Empire en hÃ´tel. Au tournant du siÃ¨cle, des maisons plus modestes viennent s'ajouter Ã  l'ensemble. Vers 1902, le docteur William James Enright (1873-1918) se fait bÃ¢tir une imposante rÃ©sidence sur le banc. Le menuisier NapolÃ©on GagnÃ© (1860-1917) participe Ã  la construction de cette demeure. \n\nÃ€ la mÃªme Ã©poque, la compagnie ferroviaire Atlantic, Quebec and Western Railway projette de relier les villes de PaspÃ©biac et de GaspÃ©. Le chemin de fer rejoint Port-Daniel en 1907 et une gare est construite l'annÃ©e suivante. La gare possÃ¨de des dimensions importantes parce qu'elle constitue le terminus temporaire de la ligne. L'arrivÃ©e de la voie ferrÃ©e favorise le dÃ©veloppement de Port-Daniel. La municipalitÃ© autrefois isolÃ©e devient un carrefour commercial important oÃ¹ s'arrÃªtent de nombreux commis-voyageurs. Alfred Dumaresq Legrand profite de ce contexte favorable pour agrandir son hÃ´tel et Ã©riger un bÃ¢timent, le Â« Sample Room Â» (aujourd'hui disparu), servant Ã  exposer la marchandise des commerÃ§ants itinÃ©rants. En 1911, le chemin de fer rejoint la ville de GaspÃ© et Port-Daniel perd peu Ã  peu de son importance. Le dÃ©veloppement du banc se poursuit nÃ©anmoins au cours des dÃ©cennies suivantes. Quelques commerces sont construits dans la partie ouest du banc et des rÃ©sidences sont Ã©rigÃ©es du cÃ´tÃ© est, dont la demeure imposante du docteur Omer Brunet (dÃ©cÃ©dÃ© en 1937). \n\nDans la deuxiÃ¨me moitiÃ© du XXe siÃ¨cle, des bÃ¢timents anciens sont dÃ©truits. Des constructions modernes s'ajoutent au site alors que certains Ã©difices sont reconvertis. Le dÃ©veloppement et l'amÃ©lioration du rÃ©seau routier quÃ©bÃ©cois dans les annÃ©es 1960 provoquent une diminution importante de l'utilisation du chemin de fer en GaspÃ©sie. Faute de clientÃ¨le, l'hÃ´tel Legrand ferme ses portes et l'Ã©difice est abandonnÃ©.\n\nEn 1989, le Centre d'hÃ©ritage britannique de la GaspÃ©sie, situÃ© Ã  New Richmond, achÃ¨te la maison Legrand. Celle-ci ne peut Ãªtre dÃ©placÃ©e Ã  cause de son Ã©tat de dÃ©tÃ©rioration avancÃ©. Le titre de propriÃ©tÃ© est retournÃ© Ã  la municipalitÃ© en 1993.\n\nLe site patrimonial de Port-Daniel est constituÃ© en 1993. L'ancien hÃ´tel est restaurÃ© en 1999 et il abrite depuis les bureaux de la municipalitÃ©, une bibliothÃ¨que, une salle communautaire et un centre d'interprÃ©tation. Plusieurs autres bÃ¢timents ont Ã©tÃ© restaurÃ©s au tournant du XXIe siÃ¨cle, dont la gare ferroviaire, qui accueille encore des passagers.

La scierie, reconstruite en 1872 Ã  la suite d'un incendie, est acquise par la Saint-Maurice Lumber en 1892 puis cÃ©dÃ©e Ã  l'International Paper en 1899. En 1910, le gouvernement du QuÃ©bec adopte une loi limitant l'exportation du bois de papeterie quÃ©bÃ©cois non transformÃ©. Cette mesure incite les AmÃ©ricains Ã  implanter des usines de pÃ¢tes et papiers sur le territoire quÃ©bÃ©cois plutÃ´t qu'aux Ã‰tats-Unis. Ainsi, un bÃ¢timent vouÃ© Ã  la transformation du bois en pÃ¢tes et papiers est construit Ã  proximitÃ© de la scierie par une filiale de l'International Paper, la CIP, vers 1919. L'usine de filtration, destinÃ©e Ã  pomper, filtrer et traiter les eaux usÃ©es de la compagnie, est probablement Ã©rigÃ©e de 1920 Ã  1921. Ã€ la fin des annÃ©es 1920, l'Ã©tablissement de la CIP devient la plus grande usine de papier journal au monde, contribuant Ã  faire de Trois-RiviÃ¨res la capitale mondiale de ce type de production.\n\nEntre 1926 et 1936, des modifications importantes sont apportÃ©es Ã  l'usine de filtration. Un agrandissement est rÃ©alisÃ© du cÃ´tÃ© est afin de loger des filtres Ã  tamis rotatifs. Une nouvelle prise d'eau, de forme octogonale, est Ã©galement construite Ã  une quinzaine de mÃ¨tres du rivage dans la riviÃ¨re Saint-Maurice. L'ancien puits d'alimentation, situÃ© plus prÃ¨s du rivage, est nÃ©anmoins conservÃ© pour servir de support Ã  la passerelle faisant le lien entre l'usine et la nouvelle prise d'eau. AprÃ¨s 1955, l'amÃ©nagement d'une salle de chloration Ã  l'extrÃ©mitÃ© sud du bÃ¢timent entraÃ®ne le percement d'une large porte sur la faÃ§ade ouest afin de permettre le dÃ©chargement des cylindres de chlore. Vers 1960, un petit appentis servant de salle Ã©lectrique est adossÃ© au mur nord de l'usine. Par la suite, trois pompes servant Ã  l'alimentation de l'usine sont ajoutÃ©es sur une plate-forme extÃ©rieure, Ã  la base du puits d'alimentation. De plus, une fenÃªtre de la faÃ§ade ouest est remplacÃ©e par une porte charretiÃ¨re, probablement pour le transport de matÃ©riel destinÃ© Ã  la maintenance des Ã©quipements de l'usine. \n\nVers 1980, l'ensemble du complexe papetier est acquis par la compagnie Produits forestiers Canadien Pacifique.

Le dÃ©veloppement de la petite municipalitÃ© de banlieue se fait en continuitÃ© avec le tissu urbain de MontrÃ©al, dans l'axe du boulevard Saint-Laurent. Un premier noyau de peuplement prend forme au carrefour de la rue Rachel et du boulevard Saint-Laurent oÃ¹ est notamment installÃ© un marchÃ© public en 1870. \n\nLe village prend son essor dans les annÃ©es 1870, alors qu'une sociÃ©tÃ© immobiliÃ¨re dirigÃ©e par Ferdinand C. David (1824-1883), SÃ©vÃ¨re Rivard (1834-1888), Gustave A. Drolet (1844-1904) et Michel Laurent (1833-1891) achÃ¨te une vaste propriÃ©tÃ© appartenant Ã  Benjamin-Godfroi Comte sise en partie dans le village de Saint-Jean-Baptiste. La propriÃ©tÃ©, qui s'Ã©tend de la rue Duluth Ã  l'avenue du Mont-Royal entre les avenues de l'HÃ´tel-de-Ville et de Chateaubriand, est subdivisÃ©e en plus de 1200 lots Ã  bÃ¢tir, essentiellement Ã  vocation rÃ©sidentielle. En juin 1872, pour attirer des mÃ©nages dans le village, la sociÃ©tÃ© immobiliÃ¨re donne Ã  monseigneur Ignace Bourget (1799-1885) une vingtaine de lots ayant front sur la rue Rachel, entre les voies projetÃ©es Drolet et Henri-Julien, pour contribuer Ã  la construction de l'Ã©glise de Saint-Jean-Baptiste. Le groupe de promoteurs est Ã©galement responsable de la construction de plusieurs maisons dans le village, en particulier sur la rue Drolet. \n\nL'Ã©glise, dÃ©diÃ©e au patron des Canadiens franÃ§ais, est inaugurÃ©e en 1874. L'Ã©glise actuelle est la troisiÃ¨me Ã  Ãªtre Ã©rigÃ©e sur le site, les deux premiÃ¨res ayant Ã©tÃ© dÃ©truites par le feu en 1898 et en 1911. Le noyau institutionnel est complÃ©tÃ© par la construction, en 1875, de l'acadÃ©mie Marie-Rose de la congrÃ©gation des Soeurs des Saints-Noms-de-JÃ©sus-et-de-Marie et, en 1894, de l'hospice Auclair. Alors que la premiÃ¨re est destinÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©ducation des jeunes filles le second offre des services aux dÃ©munis de la paroisse, notamment les enfants et les vieillards. En 1899, la gestion de l'hospice est confiÃ©e aux Soeurs de la Providence. Entre-temps, soit en 1886, le village (devenu ville en 1884) est annexÃ© Ã  la ville de MontrÃ©al.\n\nEntre 1885 et 1892 et entre 1903 et 1913, le quartier Saint-Jean-Baptiste profite de deux cycles de construction rÃ©sidentielle. C'est alors que le paysage architectural du quartier caractÃ©risÃ© par une variÃ©tÃ© de typologies d'habitation prend forme : maisons unifamiliales plus cossues en pierre et au dÃ©cor architectural Ã©laborÃ© Ã©rigÃ©es Ã  proximitÃ© des institutions ou sur la rue Saint-Denis, petits immeubles d'appartements plus modestes de deux ou trois Ã©tages abritant des mÃ©nages ouvriers. L'arrivÃ©e d'une nouvelle population favorise l'Ã©tablissement de commerces sur les rues Saint-Denis et Rachel. L'Ã©largissement de la rue Rachel vers 1927 entraÃ®ne la dÃ©molition de plusieurs Ã©difices sur le cÃ´tÃ© sud. De plus, cette intervention accentue le caractÃ¨re monumental de l'Ã©glise Saint-Jean-Baptiste. \n\nEntre la fin des annÃ©es 1920 et le milieu des annÃ©es 1950, des modifications et des agrandissements sont rÃ©alisÃ©s Ã  l'acadÃ©mie Marie-Rose et Ã  l'hospice Auclair. La dÃ©coration intÃ©rieure de l'Ã©glise est renouvelÃ©e Ã  deux reprises, en 1932 et en 1976. Dans la foulÃ©e de la RÃ©volution tranquille, l'acadÃ©mie devient l'Ã‰cole secondaire Marie-Rose entre 1965 et 1970. En 1988, les religieuses dÃ©cident de fermer l'institution qui est acquise par une sociÃ©tÃ© privÃ©e qui fonde le CollÃ¨ge Rachel. En 2001, la fonction Ã©ducative de l'Ã©difice prend fin. Quant Ã  l'hospice Auclair, agrandi Ã  trois reprises entre 1947 et 1955, il sert de centre d'hÃ©bergement pour les vieillards jusqu'au milieu des annÃ©es 1980.

DÃ¨s leur arrivÃ©e, elles fondent le pensionnat de Chicoutimi qui deviendra le CollÃ¨ge classique en 1947, premier collÃ¨ge pour filles dans la rÃ©gion. En 1873, le SÃ©minaire de Chicoutimi est fondÃ© dans une vieille maison-Ã©cole du village et est dirigÃ© par le vicaire de la paroisse, Dominique Racine (1828-1888), qui deviendra le premier Ã©vÃªque de Chicoutimi en 1878. La rue Racine Ã©voque la mÃ©moire de cet homme entiÃ¨rement dÃ©vouÃ© Ã  son diocÃ¨se.

En 1925, l'implantation d'une usine d'aluminium dans les environs de la riviÃ¨re Saguenay se confirme. L'aluminerie Alcoa, dont relÃ¨ve alors la compagnie Alcan, projette Ã©galement de fonder une ville pour ses travailleurs. Par l'entremise de sa filiale Arvida Works, elle voit Ã  l'amÃ©nagement du territoire selon un plan conÃ§u de 1925 Ã  1926; elle met aussi en chantier des maisons, des hÃ´pitaux et des commerces. En 1927, les constructions rÃ©sidentielles commencent : 270 maisons sont implantÃ©es en 135 jours. \n\nLa mÃªme annÃ©e, le premier bÃ¢timent du noyau institutionnel d'Arvida est construit. Il s'agit de la Protestant School, qui devient ultÃ©rieurement la Arvida High School, puis la Riverside Regional School. Cette Ã©cole anglophone et protestante est l'oeuvre de la sociÃ©tÃ© Arvida Works, comme la plupart des constructions de l'Ã©poque.\n\nAprÃ¨s des dÃ©buts prometteurs, l'usine vit un ralentissement au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1930. Au cours de cette pÃ©riode, les rÃ©sidents sont moins nombreux Ã  Arvida et peu de nouveaux Ã©difices sont construits. La reprise de la production Ã  partir du milieu de la dÃ©cennie amÃ¨ne un accroissement de la population qui nÃ©cessite plus de services. D'autres Ã©coles font alors leur apparition, dont une Ã©cole catholique pour les jeunes filles francophones, l'Ã©cole Sainte-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, dessinÃ©e par Ernest Isbell Barott (1884-1955). Les locaux sont partagÃ©s avec la communautÃ© catholique anglophone jusqu'Ã  l'ouverture de sa propre Ã©cole, la Saint-Patrick High School. Cette derniÃ¨re est rÃ©alisÃ©e par la firme Fetherstonhaugh, Durnford et Bolton en 1942. Ã€ partir de cette annÃ©e, la ville n'est plus gÃ©rÃ©e par la compagnie Alcan. La Commission d'urbanisme d'Arvida pour l'amÃ©nagement urbain et pour le contrÃ´le de l'architecture rÃ©git dorÃ©navant l'expansion de la municipalitÃ©. Elle est composÃ©e de professionnels issus de divers milieux, dont l'architecte Harold Lea Fetherstonhaugh (1887-1971), Frederick G. Todd (1876-1948), architecte paysagiste, et C.-O.-P. Klotz, ingÃ©nieur de l'Alcan. Un incendie dÃ©truit le premier lieu de culte de l'Ã‰glise unie. Deux nouveaux Ã©difices religieux sont alors Ã©rigÃ©s simultanÃ©ment au tournant des annÃ©es 1950 : la First United Church et l'Ã©glise Saint-George-the-Martyr. Celles-ci s'Ã©lÃ¨vent au nord du noyau institutionnel, sur un terrain appartenant depuis peu aux anglicans. L'agence Fetherstonhaugh, Durnford, Bolton et Chadwick produit les plans.\n\nLe nombre de rÃ©sidents continue Ã  croÃ®tre, particuliÃ¨rement ceux d'origine canadienne-franÃ§aise. Une autre Ã©cole est construite dans la partie sud du noyau institutionnel d'Arvida par les architectes LÃ©once DesgagnÃ© (1908-1979) et Paul-Marie CÃ´tÃ© (1921-1969). Ã‰tablie de 1951 Ã  1952, l'Ã©cole Notre-Dame-du-Sourire reÃ§oit les jeunes filles catholiques francophones.

Au milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle, la ferme de Daniel Potvin et le lot de Joseph Tremblay Â« PicotÃ© Â» occupent l'extrÃ©mitÃ© nord de l'actuel site du patrimoine, en marge du Â« village Chez Mars Â» implantÃ© plus au sud, Ã  l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re du mÃªme nom. DÃ¨s 1853, Pierre-Vincent Valin (1827-1897) et Matthew Miller ouvrent dans le secteur un petit chantier maritime, et un premier quai en eau profonde est construit vers 1860. Ã€ cette Ã©poque, de petites habitations d'un Ã©tage et demi aux toits Ã  deux versants sont implantÃ©es de part et d'autre de la rue Victoria, crÃ©ant un petit quartier ouvrier dans la partie nord de l'actuel site tandis que la partie sud-est demeure occupÃ©e par des champs et quelques fermes.\n\nÃ€ la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle, l'envoi et la rÃ©ception des produits agricoles et des marchandises destinÃ©es au marchÃ© rÃ©gional se font au quai de Bagotville et plusieurs marchands locaux bÃ©nÃ©ficient alors, entre autres, de l'important commerce des bleuets. Des hangars et des entrepÃ´ts apparaissent progressivement du cÃ´tÃ© est de la rue Victoria. La compagnie E. et R. Loggie y installe une conserverie de bleuets en 1882, l'annÃ©e mÃªme oÃ¹ AgÃ©silas Lepage et son pÃ¨re ouvrent un commerce dans leur rÃ©sidence de la rue Victoria, prÃ¨s du cimetiÃ¨re. \n\nLe paysage architectural de la rue Victoria se transforme tout au cours du XXe siÃ¨cle. L'industrialisation et l'urbanisation, favorisÃ©es par l'arrivÃ©e du chemin de fer Ã  Bagotville en 1910, entraÃ®nent des modifications dans la trame bÃ¢tie. Entre 1906 et 1922, la plupart des espaces libres sont comblÃ©s et des bÃ¢timents industriels apparaissent du cÃ´tÃ© est de la rue Victoria face Ã  la rue Saint-Georges. L'augmentation rapide de la population dans les premiÃ¨res dÃ©cennies du XXe siÃ¨cle entraÃ®ne la construction d'habitations Ã  logements multiples et le remplacement d'habitations anciennes par des constructions plus volumineuses. Quelques rÃ©sidences, qui rappellent les maisons modÃ¨les de la ville voisine de Port-Alfred, sont construites aussi sur la rue Victoria. La crÃ©ation de Port-Alfred en 1917 freine toutefois le dÃ©veloppement industriel du port de Bagotville et la rue Victoria prend peu Ã  peu une vocation plus touristique. En effet, l'artÃ¨re devient un lieu de rencontre de la communautÃ© baieriveraine qui y frÃ©quente les hÃ´tels, les restaurants et les commerces. Entre 1924 et 1965, les navires de croisiÃ¨re de la compagnie Canada Steamship Lines accostent au quai de Bagotville qui constitue tout au long des annÃ©es 1930 le terminus du transport maritime de passagers dans tout le Saguenay. L'amÃ©nagement en 1955 de la promenade Damase-Potvin en bordure de la baie au nord de l'actuel site contribue aussi Ã  l'affirmation de la vocation rÃ©crÃ©otouristique du secteur oÃ¹ apparaissent au mÃªme moment quelques rÃ©sidences modernes.\n\nDans les derniÃ¨res dÃ©cennies du XXe siÃ¨cle, des immeubles rÃ©sidentiels Ã  logements multiples s'insÃ¨rent dans la trame bÃ¢tie de la rue Victoria, notamment sur des espaces laissÃ©s libres par le dÃ©mantÃ¨lement de bÃ¢timents industriels qui faisaient face Ã  la rue Saint-Georges.

Le bÃ¢timent doit desservir les colons installÃ©s dans ce secteur alors connu sous le nom de Â« Village Chez Mars Â», en rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  Mars Simard, pionnier de l'endroit. DÃ¨s 1846, l'emplacement prÃ©vu pour le noyau institutionnel de Saint-Alphonse est identifiÃ© sur un plan de l'arpenteur Jean-Baptiste Duberger fils (vers 1795-vers 1865). L'endroit est localisÃ© sur une partie des terres de Mars Simard. Le terrain est acquis par la fabrique en 1850, puis la chapelle-Ã©cole y est dÃ©placÃ©e deux ans plus tard.\n\nLa paroisse Saint-Alphonse s'organise rapidement. Ã‰rigÃ©e canoniquement en 1857 et civilement en 1859, elle se dote d'une vÃ©ritable Ã©glise dans les annÃ©es qui suivent. L'entrepreneur local Jean-FÃ©lix Langlais obtient le contrat de construction en 1860. Les fondations sont Ã©rigÃ©es avec la pierre locale fournie par les habitants qui travaillent aussi sur le chantier. Le curÃ© Pierre Boucher, qui arrive en 1861, modifie le plan initial par l'ajout en faÃ§ade d'une fausse tour en saillie. De la pierre de taille de Deschambault est utilisÃ©e en faÃ§ade. La pierre de ChÃ¢teau-Richer sert Ã  couvrir le long pan est et le granit local, Ã  recouvrir les surfaces moins visibles. L'Ã©glise suit un plan rectangulaire avec abside en hÃ©micycle. Elle reprend les formes d'un modÃ¨le d'Ã©glise paroissiale conÃ§u par Thomas BaillairgÃ© (1792-1859). Les grandes lignes de ce modÃ¨le sont reprises par ses collaborateurs au cours du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Le clocher Ã©rigÃ© en 1867 par Guillaume Audet dit Lapointe, charpentier de Bagotville, s'inscrit dans cette tradition. L'Ã©glise est Ã©pargnÃ©e par le grand incendie de 1870, qui dÃ©truit plusieurs bÃ¢timents dans le village de Bagotville. \n\nAu dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1880, le noyau paroissial comprend l'Ã©glise, le cimetiÃ¨re qui se situe derriÃ¨re la sacristie et un petit champ sur lequel se dressent des bÃ¢timents secondaires. Un presbytÃ¨re est construit Ã  l'ouest de l'Ã©glise en 1882, tandis que le terrain en bordure de la rue de la Fabrique est amÃ©nagÃ© en espace vert. Ã€ la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle, une clÃ´ture en bois dÃ©limite l'enclos paroissial. \n\nEntre 1900 et 1930, plusieurs interventions viennent modifier le noyau institutionnel. Une premiÃ¨re institution d'enseignement fait ainsi son apparition. Les soeurs du Bon-Conseil sont Ã©tablies Ã  Bagotville depuis 1907. Leur couvent est Ã©rigÃ© en 1908 par Albert Fortin. Il s'agit d'un Ã©difice Ã  deux Ã©tages situÃ© derriÃ¨re l'Ã©glise, sur l'emplacement jusque-lÃ  occupÃ© par le cimetiÃ¨re. Entre 1906 et 1922, le curÃ© Henri Cimon fait construire, en bordure de la rue Albert, une petite rÃ©sidence pour loger des membres de sa famille. Cette habitation sert par la suite de maison pour le sacristain. En 1923, une nouvelle sacristie est annexÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©glise par A. F. Ferland, un entrepreneur de QuÃ©bec. Trois ans plus tard, un monument au SacrÃ©-Coeur est Ã©rigÃ© en faÃ§ade de l'Ã©glise. La rÃ©alisation la plus importante de cette pÃ©riode demeure toutefois la construction d'un nouveau presbytÃ¨re en 1930. La rÃ©sidence monumentale d'esprit classique est conÃ§ue par l'architecte Armand Gravel (1895-1980). \n\nUn nouveau couvent aux lignes modernes, l'Ã©cole Sainte-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, est conÃ§u en 1948 par la firme des architectes LÃ©once DesgagnÃ© (1908-1979) et Paul Boileau. Avec l'addition en 1950 d'un garage et d'une salle de rÃ©union au presbytÃ¨re, le noyau institutionnel prend l'aspect architectural qu'il conserve depuis lors. \n\nLe Noyau-Institutionnel-de-Saint-Alphonse-de-Bagotville est constituÃ© en 1991.

Cette annÃ©e-lÃ , les premiers colons arrivent dans la baie des Ha! Ha!, la grande baie du fjord du Saguenay. Parmi eux, Mars Simard s'Ã©tablit sur la rive nord de la riviÃ¨re qui porte aujourd'hui son nom. Ã€ l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re Ã  Mars, une scierie est rapidement construite. D'importantes inondations et un incendie surviennent en 1840 et 1841. La compagnie de William Price (1789-1867), un homme d'affaires britannique actif dans l'industrie forestiÃ¨re, prend alors en charge le site.

En 1846, un incendie dÃ©truit plusieurs bÃ¢timents, facilitant ainsi la mise en oeuvre de la trame de rues orthogonale de Duberger, qui dÃ©finit les contours du village de Bagotville.\n\nAu milieu du XIXe siÃ¨cle, quelques constructions situÃ©es prÃ¨s de l'ancien tracÃ© de la rue Mars bordent l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re. S'y retrouvent, entre autres, la propriÃ©tÃ© de William Price, la forge de William Sammon, l'ancien quai de Mars Simard et quelques maisons de colonisation. L'alignement de bÃ¢timents prend forme sur des lots rectangulaires Ã©troits en bordure est de la rue Albert. Ã€ cette Ã©poque, ce lotissement annonce dÃ©jÃ  celui d'aujourd'hui. La plupart des noms de rues apparaissant sur le plan de 1859 et balisant l'espace du noyau villageois constituent encore aujourd'hui l'essentiel de l'hÃ©ritage toponymique du secteur. \n\nAvec les difficultÃ©s de l'industrie du sciage, le paysage villageois de Bagotville Ã©volue lentement dans les derniÃ¨res dÃ©cennies du XIXe siÃ¨cle. Plusieurs bÃ¢timents sont dÃ©truits lors de l'incendie de 1870 et la partie sud du village est Ã  nouveau touchÃ©e par une importante inondation en 1871. Ã€ la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle, le secteur ne compte encore qu'une dizaine d'habitations entourÃ©es de bÃ¢timents de ferme. Le paysage bÃ¢ti ne montre alors principalement que des maisons au toit Ã  deux versants retroussÃ©s Ã  travers lesquelles se trouvent quelques rÃ©sidences au toit mansardÃ©. Un nouvel alignement de maisons apparaÃ®t en face de l'Ã©glise, en bordure sud de la rue de la Fabrique. Cependant, une grande partie de l'espace villageois demeure occupÃ© par des champs jusqu'au dÃ©but du XXe siÃ¨cle. \n\nL'arrivÃ©e du chemin de fer Ã  Bagotville en 1910 assure l'industrialisation du Bas-Saguenay.

La population villageoise passe de 507 habitants en 1901 Ã  2204 en 1921. Cette croissance dÃ©mographique se traduit dans l'espace par l'apparition de nouveaux alignements de bÃ¢timents. Notamment, quelques maisons plus cossues s'Ã©lÃ¨vent au sud de la rue Bagot. Des maisons individuelles ouvriÃ¨res ainsi que des habitations Ã  logements multiples modifient aussi l'ensemble bÃ¢ti. Les champs et les anciens bÃ¢timents de ferme disparaissent progressivement. Quelques rÃ©sidences aux lignes plus modernes s'insÃ¨rent dans le paysage vers le milieu du XXe siÃ¨cle.

Une grille de rues suit les rives de la baie et de la riviÃ¨re, entre ces plans d'eau et l'escarpement rocheux. Duberger y configure Ã  ce moment les lots de la partie sud-ouest de la rue de la Fabrique - lieu-dit de la CÃ´te-de-la-Fabrique - sur lesquels se trouvent alors la grange et l'Ã©table de Mars Simard. \n\nÃ€ la fin des annÃ©es 1850, la Fabrique de la paroisse de Saint-Alphonse dÃ©tient une large part des emplacements longeant la rue de la Fabrique.

Divers facteurs expliquent cette augmentation. Il s'agit notamment de l'arrivÃ©e du chemin de fer Ã  Bagotville en 1910 et de la crÃ©ation de la ville voisine de Port-Alfred Ã  la fin des annÃ©es 1910. Cette derniÃ¨re se trouve situÃ©e sur la rive opposÃ©e de la riviÃ¨re Ã  Mars. Fort de cet accroissement, Bagotville obtient le statut de ville en 1920. Durant cette pÃ©riode, des maisons avec un toit Ã  deux versants ou un toit mansardÃ© font leur apparition dans le secteur de la cÃ´te de la Fabrique. Une maison de villÃ©giature est aussi construite sur un petit plateau (boulevard de la Grande-Baie Nord), prÃ¨s de l'ancien hÃ´tel McLean. Vers 1910, on perce la rue Cimon vers le nord entre la rue Albert et le boulevard de la Grande-Baie Nord. Cette rue en pente se blottit elle aussi aux pieds de l'escarpement. Elle complÃ¨te ainsi l'occupation du village au bas de l'escarpement rocheux.\n\nAprÃ¨s la Seconde Guerre mondiale, la croissance de la ville de Bagotville se rÃ©alise surtout dans les nouveaux lotissements en amont du village, sur l'escarpement rocheux.

Les hauteurs de l'escarpement rocheux surplombant le village et la baie des Ha! Ha! attirent cependant les plus fortunÃ©s. L'industriel et homme politique David Edward Price (1826-1883) y construit une demeure vers 1870, sur l'actuel boulevard de la Grande-Baie Nord. Price vend ses propriÃ©tÃ©s situÃ©es dans cette partie du village au milieu des annÃ©es 1880. La qualitÃ© de la localisation attire Peter McLean qui acquiert la maison de Price et la transforme en Ã©tablissement hÃ´telier vers 1885.

Celui-ci s'affirme comme l'architecte le plus en vue de la rÃ©gion Ã  cette Ã©poque : Lamontagne vient de complÃ©ter trois ans auparavant les plans de la reconstruction de la cathÃ©drale Saint-FranÃ§ois-Xavier de Chicoutimi. Le projet de l'acadÃ©mie tarde toutefois Ã  se mettre en branle et Lamontagne doit revoir ses plans en 1925. Entre autres choses, le clocheton devant couronner l'Ã©difice est alors abandonnÃ©. L'acadÃ©mie Saint-Alphonse est finalement construite en 1927. L'Ã©difice est implantÃ© Ã  l'ouest de l'ancien hÃ´tel McLean, Ã  environ 50 mÃ¨tres d'altitude. Surplombant la baie des Ha! Ha!, il s'agit de l' Â« un des plus beaux sites de la province de QuÃ©bec Â» selon un frÃ¨re du SacrÃ©-Coeur. L'Ã©cole de deux Ã©tages et demi, Ã©rigÃ©e au coÃ»t de 77 000 dollars, comprend sept classes permettant d'accueillir 250 Ã©lÃ¨ves. L'Ã©difice, assez inusitÃ© avec son allure de maison bourgeoise austÃ¨re et ses murs coupe-feu, s'apparente peu Ã  l'architecture conventuelle de l'Ã©poque. \n\nSur le site de leur acadÃ©mie, les FrÃ¨res du SacrÃ©-Coeur Ã©rigent une croix illuminÃ©e d'ampoules Ã©lectriques dans les annÃ©es 1930. Ils amÃ©nagent ensuite, dans le bois Ã  l'arriÃ¨re de la propriÃ©tÃ©, une grotte dÃ©diÃ©e Ã  Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes. Ce type de grotte, appelÃ© Â« grotte de dÃ©votion Â» se retrouve dans de nombreuses paroisses du QuÃ©bec. Il puise ses origines Ã  Lourdes, en France, oÃ¹ les autoritÃ©s catholiques reconnaissent depuis 1858 une sÃ©rie de guÃ©risons miraculeuses. Des bÃ¢timents secondaires (aujourd'hui disparus) sont aussi construits durant cette pÃ©riode.\n\nEn 1960, les commissaires d'Ã©coles du village de Bagotville cÃ¨dent des terrains Ã  l'est du boulevard de la Grande-Baie Nord Ã  la Ville de Bagotville. Le parc Elgin, aujourd'hui connu sous le nom de parc McLean, voit le jour peu aprÃ¨s. En 1969, les FrÃ¨res du SacrÃ©-Coeur quittent la direction de l'Ã©cole Saint-Alphonse. Le bÃ¢timent est ensuite intÃ©grÃ© dans le rÃ©seau de la commission scolaire rÃ©gionale. En 2007, l'ancienne acadÃ©mie sert de centre de formation intÃ©grÃ© en entreprise. \n\nLe site du patrimoine de l'Ancienne-AcadÃ©mie-Saint-Alphonse-de-Bagotville est constituÃ© en 1991.

Ha! traversent une premiÃ¨re phase de dÃ©veloppement liÃ©e au mouvement de colonisation Ã  la fin des annÃ©es 1830. Ensuite, au XXe siÃ¨cle, elles connaissent un processus d'urbanisation et d'industrialisation. L'arrivÃ©e du chemin de fer Ã  Bagotville en 1910 facilite cet essor. En 1920, le village de Bagotville obtient le statut de ville. \n\nAu dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1950, la croissance dÃ©mographique est favorisÃ©e par les activitÃ©s de la base militaire de Bagotville inaugurÃ©e en 1942. De plus, l'Ã©panouissement de l'industrie de l'aluminium dans la rÃ©gion entraÃ®ne la crÃ©ation de nouvelles paroisses et la construction d'Ã©coles. La rÃ©gion du Saguenay s'enrichit alors d'Ã©glises conÃ§ues par des architectes ayant recours Ã  des innovations techniques et formelles. La paroisse de Saint-Marc est crÃ©Ã©e en 1953 lors de son dÃ©tachement de celle de Saint-Alphonse. Les paroissiens habitant le secteur ouest de la ville de Bagotville Ã©voquent alors la distance et l'exiguÃ¯tÃ© de l'Ã©glise Saint-Alphonse pour convaincre le diocÃ¨se de Chicoutimi de crÃ©er une nouvelle paroisse. La majoritÃ© des terrains oÃ¹ sont Ã©rigÃ©s l'Ã©glise, le presbytÃ¨re et les Ã©coles sont cÃ©dÃ©s gratuitement. Le curÃ© de la nouvelle paroisse, Charles-Auguste Boily, fait Ã©riger en 1953 une chapelle temporaire Ã  partir d'un bÃ¢timent dÃ©saffectÃ© provenant d'Arvida et reconstruit sur place. Au dÃ©but de 1955, les marguilliers entament des dÃ©marches en vue d'obtenir les fonds nÃ©cessaires Ã  la construction d'une nouvelle Ã©glise. Le curÃ© Boily engage l'architecte Paul-Marie CÃ´tÃ© (1921-1969) pour en concevoir les plans. DÃ¨s juillet 1955, le chantier est ouvert et la coulÃ©e de la voÃ»te du sanctuaire est rÃ©alisÃ©e en deux jours. L'Ã©glise est inaugurÃ©e en janvier 1956. Quelques annÃ©es aprÃ¨s la cÃ©lÃ©bration de la premiÃ¨re messe, un carillon de trois cloches fabriquÃ©es en France est installÃ© dans le clocher. Au mÃªme moment, la statue de saint Marc Ã©crivant l'Ã‰vangile est dÃ©voilÃ©e. \n\nAu cours des annÃ©es 1950, l'Ã©tablissement d'une Ã©cole est Ã©galement rÃ©clamÃ© par les nouveaux habitants du secteur. AprÃ¨s avoir frÃ©quentÃ© des classes amÃ©nagÃ©es dans une rÃ©sidence, les Ã©lÃ¨ves bÃ©nÃ©ficient de la nouvelle Ã©cole primaire Saint-Marc (l'actuel Atelier des Arts). Cette Ã©cole, ouverte en septembre 1955, est dirigÃ©e par les religieuses du Bon-Conseil. Assez rapidement, le surpeuplement des classes incite les autoritÃ©s scolaires Ã  faire construire une deuxiÃ¨me Ã©cole devant Ãªtre frÃ©quentÃ©e par les enfants des paroisses adjacentes. L'architecte Paul-Marie CÃ´tÃ© conÃ§oit alors un bÃ¢timent scolaire s'harmonisant avec l'Ã©glise moderne voisine. Ouverte en septembre 1962, l'Ã©cole Georges-Vanier conserve sa vocation originale, tandis que l'Ã©cole Saint-Marc est transformÃ©e en centre culturel en 1973. La mÃªme annÃ©e, ayant mal rÃ©sistÃ© aux intempÃ©ries, la toiture de l'Ã©glise fait l'objet d'importants travaux de rÃ©fection. Pour rÃ©gler le problÃ¨me des fissures dans la voÃ»te de bÃ©ton, un revÃªtement mÃ©tallique Ã©maillÃ© blanc est installÃ© pour recouvrir la toiture. \n\nLe site du patrimoine Noyau-Institutionnel-de-Saint-Marc-de-Bagotville est constituÃ© en 1991.

L'actuel site du patrimoine se situe Ã  l'extrÃ©mitÃ© ouest de la ville.\n\nEn 1918 et 1919, la SociÃ©tÃ© de construction ouvriÃ¨re construit les premiÃ¨res maisons des travailleurs - quatre modÃ¨les d'habitation sont proposÃ©s - ainsi que les infrastructures de la ville naissante. Dubuc fonde une autre entreprise en 1919, la Ha! Ha! Bay Land and Building Co., qui introduit trois nouveaux modÃ¨les de rÃ©sidence. Deux sont Ã©laborÃ©s par l'architecte Alfred Lamontagne, celui-lÃ  mÃªme qui est responsable de la conception des Ã©difices institutionnels de la ville. Les modÃ¨les de Lamontagne sont trÃ¨s populaires. Il y en a plus d'une vingtaine d'exemplaires sur la seule 4e Rue en 1920 et 1921. Au dÃ©but des annÃ©es 1920, le pÃ©rimÃ¨tre initial des rues de Port-Alfred comprend dÃ©jÃ  plus d'une centaine de maisons, dont environ une trentaine uniquement sur la 4e Rue.\n\nEn 1919, Port-Alfred obtient le statut de ville, ce qui facilite les emprunts colossaux que nÃ©cessitent les projets immobiliers de cette envergure.

La construction rÃ©sidentielle redÃ©marre dans la seconde moitiÃ© des annÃ©es 1920 sous la tutelle de la Port Alfred Pulp and Paper Corporation. Contrairement aux entreprises de Dubuc, cette compagnie vend directement les maisons aux particuliers. Elle propose quatre nouveaux modÃ¨les. Au moins deux de ces derniers trouvent preneurs parmi les nouveaux propriÃ©taires de la 4e Rue.

Bay Sulphite Company Limited. La charte de la compagnie prÃ©voit aussi la construction de maisons pour les ouvriers. De plus, le projet de Dubuc est plus large, Ã  savoir la fondation d'une ville de compagnie. Les toponymes de la paroisse Saint-Ã‰douard, Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement en 1917, et de la ville de Port-Alfred, un statut obtenu en 1919, soulignent son rÃ´le de fondateur. \n\nLa construction de l'usine de pÃ¢te chimique (essentielle Ã  la fabrication du papier) commence en 1916 et se termine vers la fin de l'annÃ©e 1917. ParallÃ¨lement, la nouvelle ville prend forme. Une chapelle en bois, un presbytÃ¨re et une Ã©cole sont construits en 1918 et 1919. Les entreprises de Dubuc font cependant faillite dÃ¨s 1922 et 1923. La croissance de la ville est ralentie. Elle se poursuit toutefois sous la tutelle de la Port Alfred Pulp and Paper Corporation dans la seconde moitiÃ© des annÃ©es 1920. La chapelle assure alors difficilement les services paroissiaux. L'architecte Alfred Lamontagne (1883-1967) est alors mandatÃ© pour rÃ©aliser les plans d'une nouvelle Ã©glise de style gothique anglais. Ce style reflÃ¨te la provenance d'une partie des capitaux nÃ©cessaires Ã  sa construction. Trois ans plus tard, l'Ã©glise, conÃ§ue avec l'aide d'Armand Gravel (1895-1980) et Sylvio Brassard, est terminÃ©e. Elle possÃ¨de une structure en bÃ©ton et en acier. Presque au mÃªme moment, en 1928, le deuxiÃ¨me presbytÃ¨re de la paroisse est complÃ©tÃ©, une rÃ©alisation des mÃªmes architectes. \n\nOutre les Ã©difices religieux, Lamontagne conÃ§oit aussi Ã  cette Ã©poque deux autres Ã©difices majeurs dans le noyau institutionnel. L'Ã©cole des Soeurs de Notre-Dame du Bon-Conseil (Ã©cole MÃ©dÃ©ric-Gravel) est inaugurÃ©e en 1922. L'hÃ´tel de ville de Port-Alfred, auquel collaborent encore une fois Armand Gravel et Sylvio Brassard, est construit en 1932. Affichant un classicisme franÃ§ais, il abrite, entre autres, une caserne de pompiers, le bureau du maire, la salle du conseil municipal et les bureaux du tÃ©lÃ©phone et du tÃ©lÃ©graphe. \n\nLa crise des annÃ©es 1930 frappe durement Port-Alfred et force la fermeture des installations portuaires et de l'usine. La Consolidated Paper Corporation reprend les actifs de l'usine en 1932. Il faut cependant attendre la Seconde Guerre mondiale pour connaÃ®tre une vÃ©ritable relance de la ville. De nouvelles constructions voient ainsi le jour dans le noyau institutionnel. Le couvent accueille seulement des filles depuis 1928 en raison de l'ouverture du collÃ¨ge Saint-Ã‰douard. Il est agrandi en 1940 et un Ã©tage est alors ajoutÃ© Ã  l'Ã©difice de 1922. Le toit Ã  quatre versants est remplacÃ© par un toit plat. En plus, l'aile arriÃ¨re et les pavillons de la faÃ§ade d'origine (Lamontagne et Gravel, architectes) sont agrandis.

Les terres alors rÃ©servÃ©es au clergÃ© protestant sont rachetÃ©es par Philemon Wright (1760-1839) qui les subdivise et les loue Ã  rente constituÃ©e.\n\nL'occupation de Â« Long Point Range Â» ne s'amorce vÃ©ritablement qu'Ã  partir de 1830. Les maisons construites sur les rues Jacques-Cartier et Saint-Jean-Baptiste (celle-ci forme maintenant la continuitÃ© de la rue Jacques-Cartier) sont caractÃ©risÃ©es par leur implantation sur des lots Ã©troits, qui font face Ã  la riviÃ¨re. Ces habitations destinÃ©es Ã  la classe ouvriÃ¨re sont communÃ©ment appelÃ©es Â« maisons allumettes Â».\n\nLe 8 octobre 1840, la paroisse Saint-FranÃ§ois-de-Sales est Ã©rigÃ©e canoniquement. Au cours de la mÃªme annÃ©e, une chapelle en bois est construite Ã  l'embouchure de la riviÃ¨re Gatineau.\n\nLes riviÃ¨res Gatineau et des Outaouais constituent Ã  cette Ã©poque les principales voies de communication de la rÃ©gion. Elles assurent notamment le transport du bois et des produits agricoles et contribuent ainsi de faÃ§on importante au dÃ©veloppement de la communautÃ©.

Originaire de Rimouski, Bouillon rÃ©alise plusieurs projets d'architecture religieuse, dont l'Ã©vÃªchÃ© de Rimouski et la basilique-cathÃ©drale Notre-Dame Ã  Ottawa. Quelques annÃ©es plus tard, soit en 1886, la chapelle en bois est dÃ©molie. Elle est alors remplacÃ©e par une Ã©glise en pierre de style nÃ©ogothique, Ã©galement conÃ§ue par Bouillon.\n\nEn 1895, les compagnies Viau et Lachance ainsi que Dominion Bridge entreprennent la construction d'un pont reliant Pointe-Gatineau et Hull. Quelques annÃ©es plus tard, il est nommÃ© Lady-Aberdeen en souvenir de l'Ã©pouse de Sir John Campbell Hamilton Gordon (1847-1934), comte d'Aberdeen, gouverneur gÃ©nÃ©ral du Canada entre 1893 et 1898. Lady Gordon est sauvÃ©e de la noyade par des habitants du village quand sa voiture tombe dans la riviÃ¨re Gatineau en 1895. En guise de remerciements, elle offre une cloche pour l'Ã©glise paroissiale.\n\nEn raison de ses terres fertiles, l'agriculture reprÃ©sente l'une des principales occupations des habitants de Pointe-Gatineau.
